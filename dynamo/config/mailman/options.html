		This option only takes effect if you've subscribed to

		default delivery rule is for messages that don't match
		any topic filter.  Selecting <em>No</em> says that if
		the message does not match any topic filters, then you
		won't get the message, while selecting <em>Yes</em>
		says to deliver such non-matching messages to you.
