The administrative requests are displayed in one of two ways, on a <a
href="%(summaryurl)s">summary page</a>, and on a <em>details</em> page. 
The summary page contains pending subscription and unsubscription
requests, as well as postings being held for your approval, grouped by
sender email address.  The details page contains a more detailed view of
each held message, including the all the message's headers and an
excerpt of the message body.

<p>On all the pages, the following actions are available:

<ul> <li><b>Defer</b> -- Defer your decision until later.  No action is
taken now for this pending administrative request, but for held
postings, you can still forward or preserve the message (see below).

<li><b>Approve</b> -- Approve the message, sending it on to the list.
For membership requests, approve the change in membership status.

<li><b>Reject</b> -- Reject the message, sending a rejection notice to
the sender, and discarding the original message.  For membership
requests, reject the change in membership status.  In either case, you
should add a reason for the rejection in the accompanying text box.

<li><b>Discard</b> -- Throw away the original message, without sending a
rejection notice.  For membership requests, this simply discards the
request without notice to the person making the request.  This is
usually the action you want to take for known spam. </ul>

<p>For held messages, turn on the <b>Preserve</b> option if you want to
save a copy of the message for the site administrator.  This is useful
for abusive messages that you want to discard, but need to keep a record
of for later inspection.

<p>Turn on the <b>Forward to</b> option, and fill in the forwarding
address if you want to forward the message to someone else not on the
list.  To edit a held message before it is sent on to the list, you
should forward the message to yourself (or the list owners), and discard
the original message.  Then, when the message shows up in your mailbox,
make your edits and resend the message to the list, including an
<tt>Approved:</tt> header with the list password as its value.  It is
proper netiquette in this case to include a note in the resent message,
explaining that you have modified the text.

<p>If the sender is a list member who is being moderated, you can
optionally clear their moderation flag.  This is useful when your list
is configured to put new members on probation, and you've decided that
this member can be trusted to post to the list without approval.

<p>If the sender is not a list member, you can add the email address to
a <em>sender filter</em>.  Sender filters are described on the <a
href="%(filterurl)s">sender filter privacy page</a>, and may be one of
<b>auto-accept</b> (Accepts), <b>auto-hold</b> (Holds),
<b>auto-reject</b> (Rejects), or <b>auto-discard</b> (Discards).  This
option will not be available if the address is already on one of the
sender filters.

<p>When you're finished, click on the <em>Submit All Data</em> button at
the top or bottom of the page.  This button will submit all selected
actions for all administrative requests that you've made a decision for.
