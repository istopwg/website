<h2><font color="#FF0000">Major Companies Players Unite to
Deliver Internet Printing Standard</font></h2>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><em><b><i><tt>IETF Creates an Internet
Printing Protocol Working Group to Deliver New Open Standard</tt></i></b></em></font></h3>

<p>The Printer Working Group, a coalition of key worldwide
printing experts representing many printer and print server
vendors, today announced a major effort to establish standards
that will make printing on the Internet easier and more
productive.</p>

<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has chartered the
Internet Printing Protocol Working Group with the creation of a
single standard interface for printing on the Internet. Built on
existing Internet technologies, the Internet Printing Protocol,
or IPP, will be quickly deployed to provide easy to use printing
interfaces across a broad range of printing systems and operating
systems which will inter-operate using the protocol.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Just as there exists a standard protocol for
    browsing documents on the World Wide Web, it is critical that
    key printing industry players implement a standard protocol
    for submitting documents over the Internet to remote
    printers. With active participation by major printer,
    browser, and networking companies, the IPP Working Group is
    on a fast track to provide such a solution,&quot; said
    Charles LeCompte, President, Lyra Research Inc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently, there is no standard for Internet print job
submission and in order to meet a wide variety of customer
printing needs, printer vendors today must support a number of
different protocols and variants. There is a need for a single
protocol which can cover the most common requirements for
printing on the Internet and intranets, including locating a
printer and viewing its status and capabilities, as well as
submitting, monitoring and canceling a print job.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;This new working group will define a new
    industry-standard print submission and control protocol
    allowing end users to submit and control print jobs over the
    Internet and across enterprise intranets,&quot; said Don
    Wright, Chair of the Printer Working Group and Lexmark
    International's Manager of Strategic Alliances. &quot;We are
    fortunate to have all the major printer, printing, and print
    server companies participating in this effort including
    Adobe, Canon, Dataproducts, DAZEL, Hewlett-Packard, IBM,
    Kyocera, Lexmark, Microsoft, Netscape Communications
    Corporation, Novell, Osicom/DPI, QMS, Ricoh, SDSU/Start Tech,
    Sharp, Sun Microsystems, Tektronix, TrueSpectra, Underscore
    and Xerox.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Internet Printing Protocol is expected to be a
client/server protocol that allows the server to be either a
separate print server or a printer with embedded networking and
server capabilities. The focus of this effort is optimized for
printers, but it could also be applied to other output devices.</p>

<h4>History of the IPP Working Group</h4>

<p>Chartered by the PWG, the Internet Printing Protocol working
group was formed in November 1996 and began developing necessary
standards for print job submission and monitoring for the
Internet based on early submissions by IBM, Novell and Xerox.</p>

<p>After a successful &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; session at
the December1996 IETF meeting in San Jose, CA, this group was
also charteredby the IETF on March 6, 1997. The PWG earlier
developed the SNMP Printer MIB (RFC1759) and is currently working
on a Job Monitoring MIB; both are IETF projects.</p>

<p>Representatives from Adobe, IBM, Lexmark, Novell, Sun, and
Xerox act as chairs, authors, and editors for the IPP project.
Internet drafts</p>

<p>Internet drafts covering requirements, model and semantics,
directory schema, security, and the protocol have been submitted
to the IETF and will continue to be revised and become Request
for Comments (RFCs).</p>

<p>The first formal meeting of the IPP working group at an IETF
meeting was held in Memphis, TN on April 8th.</p>

<h4>Impact</h4>

<p>The Internet Printing Protocol is expected to revolutionize
printing in the computer industry. It will provide a single
standard interface for interrogating the capabilities and state
of a printing system, submitting a print job, and monitoring the
state of that print job.</p>

<p>IPP will be quickly deployed to provide easy to use printing
interfaces across a broad range of printing systems and operating
systems which will inter-operate using the protocol.</p>

<p>The following examples illustrate some of the capabilities
made possible by widespread deployment of the protocol:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A business analyst wants to print another company's
        financial report, stored on a public web server, on a
        shared departmental printer. The analyst locates a
        suitable printer using a web browser and then submits the
        print request to the printing system by providing the URL
        of the document. The document is retrieved and printed by
        the printing system which then notifies the researcher. </li>
    <li>An independent insurance agent wants to print a copy of a
        report on a public printer at the home office of one of
        the insurance companies that she represents. She then
        chooses print from her application's file menu, and
        enters the URL of the home office's public printer. The
        request is transmitted to the printing system in the home
        office and printed. </li>
</ul>

<p>IPP will provide a cost-effective and reliable way to print
documents such as reports, invoices, schedules, and forms to
remote printers which today are often sent over long-distance
telephone lines using fax.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Computer users will be able to print to printers
    anywhere within their organization, independent of locations,
    and can just as easily send print jobs to customers, partners
    etc. without the need to use e-mail or other distribution
    methods before documents are printed,&quot; said Carl-Uno
    Manros, co-chair of the IPP working group and Principal
    Engineer with Xerox Corporation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;We are building upon the long, successful
    experiences of this group developing printing job submission
    and management standards,&quot; added Steve Zilles, co-chair
    of the IPP working group and Manager of Standards for Adobe.</p>

<h4>How to get involved</h4>

<p>The IPP Working Group is open to any company or individual
interested in developing new standards for Internet printing. The
group meets regularly in person and on telephone conference
