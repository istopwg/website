<h1>Meeting Planning Guidelines</h1>

<hr>

<p>The PWG operates its meeting by having volunteers to plan, organize and run the
logistics of the meetings.&nbsp; Over time, the group has learned how to deal with the
contracts and others details of the hotels.&nbsp; The following checklist should serve as
a handy aid in planning the meeting logistics.</p>

<h3>Hotel Selection Criteria</h3>

<p>1) The hotel should ideally be situated in a location where after meeting activities
can be done with relative ease.&nbsp; Locations that are miles from restaurants, etc.are
often less than ideal.&nbsp; Locations with good access to public transportation and good
access to the airport through a free shuttle are especially good.&nbsp; Additionally, the
location should have convenient places where lunch can be had in a 1 to 1.5 hour lunch
break.</p>

<p>2) The hotel must have full air conditioning and heating.&nbsp; (The PWG's meetings
prove Murphy's law by holding meeting in places that should be cool and the weather turns
out to be hot and vice versa.)&nbsp; It is recommended that the hotel offer a full range
of services including faxing, room service, parking, etc.</p>

<p>3) The hotel shall provide high quality analog modem capable telephone lines in each
sleeping room.&nbsp; High speed internet connection via ethernet is nice but not required.</p>

<h3>The PWG's Needs during the Meeting</h3>

<p>1) Morning food should consist roughly of a selection of juices, pastries and fruit in
addition to regular and decaf coffee.&nbsp; Hot water and a selection of teas should be
offered.&nbsp; This food must remain accessible until the noon break.&nbsp; A mid-morning
refresh with more coffee and the addition of ice and soft drinks is also nice to do.</p>

<p>2) An afternoon break consisting of coffee/tea as well as ice and cold beverages (soft
drinks, bottled water, etc.) must be ordered.&nbsp; The food of this afternoon break can
be just about anything with broad appeal including: 

<ul>
  <li>cookies, brownies or other &quot;sweets&quot;</li>
  <li>chips, pretzels and other salty treats</li>
  <li>ice cream sundaes</li>
  <li>ice cream bars</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>There should be <font color="#FF0000">NO</font> deviation from #1 and #2 above for any
reason including local cultural differences or preferences.&nbsp; By providing these
services, the needs of all the participants from around the world can be met.</p>

<p>3) The hotel should provide seating for the number of attendees planned in a
&quot;U&quot; shaped configuration.&nbsp; In addition, an overhead projector and screen
should also be ordered unless one or both are being provided by a PWG participant. &nbsp;
Electrical outlets for laptops should also be provided and be located in the center of the
&quot;U&quot; shaped area.</p>

<p>4) Meeting charges to cover the meeting room, food and A/V items should normally be in
the $40 per day range.</p>

<h3>Hotel Contracts</h3>

<p>1) The hotels like to lock you into a contract with no means of escape should something
happen to change or cancel the meeting.&nbsp; As such, it is not recommended that you
agree to immediate &quot;liquidated damages&quot; should the meeting be canceled.&nbsp;
Instead, offer liquidated damages only if the meeting is canceled and NOT rescheduled
within 6 to 12&nbsp; months.</p>

<p>2) Hotels have a lot of flexibility in what they charge for the meeting room.&nbsp; It
is usually quite possible to negotiated the price down into the $100 per day range. &nbsp;
Don't accept the first price they offer.</p>

<p>3) The hotel contract should allow you to specify the amount of food to be provided as
close as possible to the actual meeting date.&nbsp; Normally it is sufficient to order
food for about 80%-90% of the number of people attending.&nbsp; Be sure the hotel knows
that the number of chairs to be in the room is one number and the amount of food to be
provided is another number.&nbsp; It is alway better to have more chairs and table space
available than the number of signed up participants would suggest.&nbsp; Most participants
are using laptops and shuffling papers so having them sit shoulder to shoulder around a
crowded table is not productive.</p>

<p>4) Negotiate the cut-off date for registration with the hotel to be as late, i.e. as
close to the meeting date, as possible</p>

<p>5) Estimate the number of rooms needed to be 20 per night from Sunday until Thursday
night.&nbsp; Friday night should be about 5.&nbsp; Make sure the contract doesn't commit
you to these numbers.</p>

<h3>Participant Payment</h3>

<p>1) At this time, <a href="mailto:lstein@fapo.com">Larry Stein</a> of Warp 9 has the
ability to provided a web based payment method to cover the cost of the meeting room,
food, etc.&nbsp; Contact him before the meeting with the per day charge number.&nbsp; Make
sure you have a plan with Larry to be paid or have the hotel paid from the monies
collected by the web page service.</p>

<p>2) Alternatively, if the hotel is willing to do so, meeting charges can be accumulated
by the hotel and charged to the participant's room or credit card.</p>

<h3>Before the Meeting</h3>

<p>1) Notify the PWG Chair <a href="mailto:(don@lexmark.com">(don@lexmark.com</a>) of the
hotel selected with the details for publication on the Web Page</p>

<p>2) Send a note to the <a href="mailto:PWG-ANNOUNCE@PWG.ORG">PWG-ANNOUNCE@PWG.ORG</a>
mailing list with that information and asking for attendees to &quot;ping&quot; you with
their meeting attendance plans.&nbsp; Include a pointer to the meeting payment web page if
you are using that service from Larry Stein.</p>

<p>3) Keep a list of those attending and several weeks before the meeting publish that
list to the mailing list above.</p>

<p>4) Make sure all catering and meeting room details are closed with the hotel a week
before the meeting.</p>

<h3>During the Meeting</h3>

<p>1) Work with the hotel on any issues or deficiencies that arrive during the course of
the week.&nbsp; (If you are not there the entire week, please arrange for someone else to
do this during your absence.)</p>
