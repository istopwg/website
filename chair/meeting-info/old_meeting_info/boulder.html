<p>Additional Information about Boulder and the Boulderado:</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Courier New"><em>The
Hotel Boulderado, established in 1909, is a historic landmark
with a &quot;historic&quot; section and a more modern wing. You
may want to request your preference although I can't guarantee it
will be available. Standard rooms tend to be a tad smaller in
&quot;historic&quot; but each is unique. Deluxe rooms in the
historic section are quite nice.</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Courier New"><em>Boulder
is located appx. 50 minutes from the Denver International
Airport. Free parking is available at the Boulderado for guests.
From DIA, take Pena Blvd south 12 miles and merge right onto I-70
West. Take I-70 to I-270 (right) and head northwest to US 36
(right). When you reach Boulder proceed left onto Canyon Blvd
