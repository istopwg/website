	      <p>The PWG has announced IPP Everywhere to enable printing from mobile devices without apps or vendor-specific drivers. In our <a href="printing-from-mobile-devices-2.html">previous post</a> we talked about the advantages of allowing native printing capabilities. Users don't have to download apps or update them. They don't have to create accounts or sign in. Touch "print", choose options, and you're good to go.</p>
