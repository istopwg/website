    <p>The Printer Working Group (PWG) is a Program of the <a href="http://www.ieee-isto.org/">IEEE Industry Standard and Technology Organization (ISTO)</a> with members including printer and multi-function device manufacturers, print server developers, operating system providers, print management application developers, and industry experts. Originally founded in 1991 as the Network Printing Alliance, the PWG is chartered to make printers, multi-function devices, and the applications and operating systems supporting them work together better.</p>
    <p>The PWG enjoys an open standards development process. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the development of our documents and standards, serve as editors, and participate in interoperability tests. Members may additionally serve as officers in the various working groups. Voting Members approve the documents and standards for publication and may serve as officers of the PWG.</p>
    <p>If you have questions about the PWG, participation in PWG activities, or membership in the PWG, please contact the <a href="mailto:chair@pwg.org">PWG Chair</a> or any other officer.</p>

    <h2>Active Workgroups</h2>

    <p>The PWG currently has two active workgroups. Click on the "More Info" links to learn more about the workgroups and how to participate.</p>

    <h3>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP)</h3>
    <p>The Internet Printing Protocol workgroup is developing standards for IPP-based multi-function services such as scanning and facsimile as well as 3D printing solutions using IPP. <a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" href="ipp/index.html">More Info</a></p>

    <h3>Semantic Model (SM)</h3>
    <p>The Semantic Model workgroup is responsible for the modeling of the services - Print, Copy, Scan, FaxIn/Out, Resource, System Control, and Transform hosted on Multifunction Devices and, more generally, Imaging Systems. Standardization supports interoperability of systems, devices, and services in local, enterprise, and cloud deployments enabling improved job submission, job management, remote administration, and support. The goal of the workgroup is to define a unified Semantic Model and set of abstract operations for the most common and essential system, service, and device features.</p>
    <p>The Semantic Model workgroup is also engaged in several mapping activities to support AFP and JDF workflows and remote monitoring and management through DTMF CIM. <a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" href="sm/index.html">More Info</a></p>

    <h2>Inactive Work Groups</h2>

    <h3>Cloud Imaging Model</h3>
    <p>The Cloud Imaging Model workgroup developed a standard to support Cloud-based printing and multifunction imaging using the PWG Semantic Model. <a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" href="cloud/index.html">More Info</a></p>

    <h3>Finisher MIB (FIN)</h3>
    <p>The Finisher MIB workgroup has concluded. Continuing support for its activities is provided by the <a href="#WIMS">Workgroup for Imaging Management Solutions (WIMS)</a> workgroup.</p>

    <h3>Imaging Device Security (IDS)</h3>
    <p>The goal of the Imaging Device Security workgroup was to address unrestrained access to and storage of secure and controlled documents and resources on modern imaging and hardcopy devices. <a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" href="ids/index.html">More Info</a></p>

    <h3>Job Monitoring Project (JMP)</h3>
    <p>The Job Monitoring Project workgroup has concluded. Continuing support for its activities is provided by the <a href="#WIMS">Workgroup for Imaging Management Solutions (WIMS)</a> workgroup.</p>

    <h3>Printer MIB Project (PMP)</h3>
    <p>The Printer MIB Project workgroup has concluded. Continuing support for its activities is provided by the <a href="#WIMS">Workgroup for Imaging Management Solutions (WIMS)</a> workgroup.</p>

    <h3><a name="WIMS">Workgroup for Imaging Management Solutions (WIMS)</a></h3>
    <p>The Workgroup for Imaging Management Solutions was concerned with the definition of new and recasting of previously defined imaging device and service management elements for mapping into standard management semantics and protocols. <a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" href="wims/index.html">More Info</a></p>
