    <p>The Printer Working Group (PWG) is a Program of the <a href="http://www.ieee-isto.org/">IEEE Industry Standard and Technology Organization (ISTO)</a> with members including printer and multi-function device manufacturers, print server developers, operating system providers, print management application developers, and industry experts. Originally founded in 1991 as the Network Printing Alliance, the PWG is chartered to make printers, multi-function devices, and the applications and operating systems supporting them work together better.</p>
    <p>The PWG enjoys an open standards development process. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the development of our documents and standards, serve as editors, and participate in interoperability tests. Members may additionally serve as officers in the various working groups. Voting Members approve the documents and standards for publication and may serve as officers of the PWG.</p>
    <p>If you have questions about the PWG, participation in PWG activities, or membership in the PWG, please contact the <a href="mailto:chair@pwg.org">PWG Chair</a> or any other officer.</p>

    <h2>Active Workgroups</h2>

    <p>The PWG currently has two active workgroups. Click on the "More Info" links to learn more about the workgroups and how to participate.</p>

    <h3 id="IPP">Internet Printing Protocol (IPP)</h3>
    <p>The Internet Printing Protocol workgroup is developing standards for IPP-based multi-function services such as scanning and facsimile as well as 3D printing solutions using IPP. <a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" href="ipp/index.html">More Info</a></p>

    <h3>Imaging Device Security (IDS)</h3>
    <p>The Imaging Device Security (IDS) workgroup is chartered to establish and provide liaisons with public standards bodies concerning security topics, standards, and protection profiles for Hardcopy Devices. <a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" href="ids/index.html">More Info</a></p>

    <h2>Inactive Work Groups</h2>

    <h3>Semantic Model (SM)</h3>
    <p>The Semantic Model workgroup was responsible for maintaining the PWG Semantic Model and defining new mappings and abstract models as needed to support interoperability and data exchange between Imaging Systems. Ongoing maintenance of the Semantic Model (using automated tools) is now being done by the <a href="#IPP">Internet Printing Protocol</a> workgroup. <a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" href="sm/index.html">More Info</a></p>

    <h3>Cloud Imaging Model</h3>
    <p>The Cloud Imaging Model workgroup developed a standard to support Cloud-based printing and multifunction imaging using the PWG Semantic Model. <a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" href="cloud/index.html">More Info</a></p>

    <h3>Finisher MIB (FIN)</h3>
    <p>The Finisher MIB workgroup has concluded. Continuing support for its activities is provided by the <a href="#IPP">Internet Printing Protocol</a> workgroup.</p>

    <h3>Job Monitoring Project (JMP)</h3>
    <p>The Job Monitoring Project workgroup has concluded. Continuing support for its activities is provided by the <a href="#IPP">Internet Printing Protocol</a> workgroup.</p>

    <h3>Printer MIB Project (PMP)</h3>
    <p>The Printer MIB Project workgroup has concluded. Continuing support for its activities is provided by the <a href="#IPP">Internet Printing Protocol</a> workgroup.</p>

    <h3><a name="WIMS">Workgroup for Imaging Management Solutions (WIMS)</a></h3>
    <p>The Workgroup for Imaging Management Solutions was concerned with the definition of new and recasting of previously defined imaging device and service management elements for mapping into standard management semantics and protocols. <a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" href="wims/index.html">More Info</a></p>
