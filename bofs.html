    <p>The Printer Working Group periodically holds "Birds of a Feather" (BOF) sessions to discuss potential new projects or work. This page provides a history of these BOF sessions.</p>
    <h2>3D Printing BOFs</h2>
    <p><b>February 4, 2015:</b> During the 3D Printing BOF we discussed a white paper submitted by Michael Sweet (Apple) for 3D Printing using IPP. Discussion will continue on the <a href="mailman/listinfo/3d-printing">PWG 3d-printing mailing list</a> and at agreed upon conference calls leading up to the April/May 2015 F2F meeting.<p>

    <p><b>August 13, 2014:</b> During the 3D Printing BOF we discussed issues with current generation 3D printers, including the lack of a common network protocol, poor status reporting, and the various document formats, with the determination being that the PWG Semantic Model <em>is</em> applicable and that it can be adapted to the hardware and technologies used for 3D printing. We will be preparing a white paper for presentation to interested 3D Printing vendors and opening discussions with ISO TC261 who is developing the ISO version of the Additive Manufacturing File Format (AMF) standard. Those wishing to participate in the development of the white paper and future 3D Printing BOFs should subscribe to the <a href="mailman/listinfo/3d-printing">PWG 3d-printing mailing list</a>.<p>
