This is a reminder, sent out once a month, about your %(hostname)s
mailing list memberships.  It includes your subscription info and how
to use it to change it or unsubscribe from a list.

You can visit the URLs to change your membership status or
configuration, including unsubscribing, setting digest-style delivery
or disabling delivery altogether (e.g., for a vacation), and so on.

In addition to the URL interfaces, you can also use email to make such
changes.  For more info, send a message to the '-request' address of
the list (for example, %(exreq)s) containing just the word 'help' in
the message body, and an email message will be sent to you with
instructions.

If you have questions, problems, comments, etc, send them to
%(owner)s.  Thanks!
