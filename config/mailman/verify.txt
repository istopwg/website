Mailing list subscription confirmation notice for mailing list %(listname)s

We have received a request%(remote)s for subscription of your email
address, "%(email)s", to the %(listaddr)s mailing list.  To confirm
that you want to be added to this mailing list, simply reply to this
message, keeping the Subject: header intact.  Or visit this web page:

Or include the following line -- and only the following line -- in a
message to %(requestaddr)s:

the right form (additional "Re:" text in the Subject: is okay).

disregard this message.  If you think you are being maliciously
subscribed to the list, or have any other questions, send them to
%(listadmin)s.
