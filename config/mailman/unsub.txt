Mailing list removal confirmation notice for mailing list %(listname)s

We have received a request%(remote)s for the removal of your email
address, "%(email)s" from the %(listaddr)s mailing list.  To confirm
that you want to be removed from this mailing list, simply reply to
this message, keeping the Subject: header intact.  Or visit this web
page:

    %(confirmurl)s

Or include the following line -- and only the following line -- in a
message to %(requestaddr)s:

    confirm %(cookie)s

Note that simply sending a `reply' to this message should work from
most mail readers, since that usually leaves the Subject: line in
the right form (additional "Re:" text in the Subject: is okay).

If you do not wish to be removed from this list, please simply
disregard this message.  If you think you are being maliciously
removed from the list, or have any other questions, send them to
%(listadmin)s.
