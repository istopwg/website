<p> The PWG held its <a href="https://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/may-2020-virtual.html" target="_blank">May 2020 Virtual Face-to-Face Meeting</a>
      on May 5-8, 2020 via WebEx teleconferences. This event was held in collaboration with Linux Foundation OpenPrinting 
Workgroup. Sessions were presented by both organizations over the 
event's 3 days. Representatives
      from Apple, Artifex, Canon, Canonical, Google, Gutenprint, High 
North, HP Inc., Kyocera,
Lakeside Robotics,      Lexmark, Qualcomm, Red Hat, Ricoh, TIC, TCS and 
Xerox attended the meetings, as well as several independent individuals.
      Attendees reviewed work in progress, including drafts of a number
      of in-progress specifications, and discussed liaisons with partner
      groups. Here is a summary of the proceedings. </p><h2> </h2>
<h2>Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup</h2>

<p>The Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup sessions were presented 
on the first 
day. Ira McDonald reviewed the Linux OpenPrinting project's 
accomplishments from 2019 and surveyed the efforts under way for 2020. 
Work continues to move from CUPS 2.2.x to 2.3, and to fully support IPP 
System Service. Ira reviewed the status of OP Google Summer of Code 
(GSoC) work to occur in 2020, as well as Google Season of Docs.<br>
</p>

<p>Aveek Basu presented a review of the Linux OpenPrinting 
Workgroup's projects that are active in 2020. He discussed in more 
detail the upcoming 
"Google Summer of Code 2020" projects that will implement frameworks for
 developing CUPS Printer Applications, 
a Linux GUI application to administer multi-function devices via the IPP
 System Service, an IPP Scan server, cups-browsed optimizations, and PDF
 raster extraction. He also covered
 the Linux OpenPrinting Workgroup's engagement in the "Linux Plumbers 
Conference", "Linux Foundation Members Summit 2020", and the "Open 
Printing Mini Conference" at Indian Institute of Technology in November 
2019. Mike Sweet presented on two CUPS Printer Application projects he 
is working on (ippeveprinter and LPrint), as well as the PAPPL Printer 
Application framework he has developed to make it easier to write CUPS 
printer applications. He described the value that Printer Applications 
provide as a more self-contained replacement for legacy printer drivers.
 His PAPPL project is a C-based framework for developing new Printer 
Applications.<br>
</p>

<p>After a short lunch break, Michael 
Vrhel reviewed the status of Ghostscript, MuPDF and 
associated projects such as MuJS and MuPDF WebAssembly. A large focus of
 the work over the last year has been pruning seldom used or incomplete 
features, especially those that cause a disproportionate number of 
defects. Sean Kau presented "Printing in Chrome OS", covering system 
details 
that differ from other operating system environments and how that 
affects printing support. Many of the software components developed 
by the Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup, as well as an unmodified
 CUPS release, are deployed as the core components of the Chrome OS 
print system. IPP Everywhere is supported out-of-box and helps to enable
 universal printing. Sean reviewed the changes made since he presented 
last in May 2019.<br>
</p>

<p>After another break, Till Kamppeter presented a detailed survey of 
completed, in-process and future work in the "cups-filters" and 
"ippusbxd" projects and related work on Driverless Scanning, CUPS in a 
Snap, and patches contributed to Avahi, a commonly used open source 
implementation of mDNS / DNS-SD. Many bug fixes were made in 2018, and 
work 
continues on both of these projects.<br>

<h2> PWG Plenary</h2>


    
<p> The PWG sessions began on the second day with the PWG Chair presenting the PWG Plenary.
      We reviewed the overall state of the PWG,
      its programs and initiatives, and briefly discussed upcoming
      face-to-face meeting scheduling. We noted that <a href="https://www.pwg.org/printers" target="_blank"> there are currently 412 printers certified</a>
 under the PWG's IPP Everywhere™
      Self Certification program, which hasn't changed in some time, but
 more certifications are believed to
      be in progress from multiple vendors pending the release of IPP 
Everywhere™v1.1. We discussed the PWG Steering Committee's 
activities and initiatives, including its 2020 goals, the status of 
Process 4.0 and updated policies, public relations efforts, recently 
approved 
documents, process document updates, the website migration initiative, 
and "toolset" alternatives for producing specifications. Each active PWG
 workgroup (<a href="https://www.pwg.org/ids/" target="_blank">IDS Workgroup</a>
      and <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/" target="_blank">IPP
        Workgroup</a>) summarized their current status. Finally, we
      reviewed the status of our partners' work in Trusted Computing
      Group (TCG), IETF, Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup, Mopria Alliance and INCITS.<br>
    </p>

    </p>
<h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup </h2>


    
<p> On the first day, Ira McDonald (IPP WG Co-Chair) and Mike Sweet 
(IPP WG Secretary) surveyed the
      status of current IPP Workgroup works in progress, noting that 
there will be an update to the charter in 2020. IPP Everywhere v1.1 and 
IPP Everywhere Self Certification v1.1 are both in PWG Call for 
Objections, ending on May 15, 
2020, and the new JSON based self-certification submission portal is 
live. After
 a break, we reviewed the latest draft of Job Accounting with IPP v1.0, 
and tangentially discussed whether a PWG Best Practices document can 
contain normative language, which will be further clarified in PWG 
policy documents following Steering Committee discussion.<br>
    </p>

    
<p>On the second day, after the IDS Workgroup session, the group 
reviewed the latest draft of IPP Enterprise Printing Extensions v2.0. 
After reviewing changes to earlier portions of the specification, the 
group observed that the "job-hold-until" attribute is not suitable for 
specifying a persistent release method in a Job, and moved to instead 
define a new attribute to satisfy this requirement. Differences with job
 state on Logical Device Printers vs. Physical Device Printers was also 
discussed.</p>
<p>On the third day, the  IPP 
Workgroup sessions started with a
      review of IPP Production Printing Extensions v2.0, which is 
nearing completion. We then discussed IPP Driverless Printing Extensions
 v2.0 and specifically had a more detailed discussion about how to address the issue of "print-quality" extensibility,
 and discussed its meaning, scope and related issues. An incremental 
path forward was proposed at the end of the discussion, that will be 
added to the next draft, as a path forward. After a break, 
Paul Tykodi (IPP WG Co-Chair and lead PWG 3D Printing Liaison) led a 
discussion on the status of the PWG's 3D Printing liaisons and the 
guidance we will be providing to our partners. We spent some time 
discussing how to bridge the "perception gaps" between what IPP 3D 
provides and what the industry is asking for, and we discussed updating 
our slides and topic page with more interaction models and other 
diagrams to paint a more complete picture. We concluded the 
IPP WG
 sessions with next steps.<br>

    </p>

    
<h2> Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup </h2>

    
    
<p>At the start of the second day, Alan Sukert (acting IDS WG Chair) led
 the IDS Workgroup
 status and progress discussion. We went through the minutes of the 
latest HCD international 
TC (iTC) meetings, discussed the 31-step cPP development plan and some 
thoughts on what the content of HCD collaborative 
Protection Profile (cPP) v1.0 should include. The scope should cover 
what is needed by 2022, to keep it on a reasonable schedule. A v1.1 
should be expected, to pick up any key SFRs not included in v1.0. 
Publishing the HCD cPP/SD 1.0 in a timely manner will establish it in 
the community and provide a foundation for further updates. Ira 
discussed Compact TLS and noted that, though it won't be in the HCD cPP 
v1.0 or the Network Device (ND) cPP in the near term, it should be 
monitored. The group then shifted to discussing Ira's draft HCD Security
 Guidelines v1.0 document, which is being written as a PWG Best 
Practices document. The group discussed which topics were in scope. Alan
 then discussed standards activities outside the HCD iTC that were 
deserving of attention, such as the IETF's RATS (Remote ATtestation 
ProcedureS) and SAAG (Security Area Advisory Group). We wrapped up with 
next steps.<br>
