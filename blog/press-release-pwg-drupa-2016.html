    <h2 align="center">ISTO PRINTER WORKING GROUP TO PRESENT ON INDUSTRY STANDARDS FOR 3D PRINTING AT DRUPA 2016</h2>
    <meta name="Title" content="">
    
    <p><b>PISCATAWAY, N.J., May 31, 2016</b> – The Institute
    of Electrical and Electronics Engineers - Industry Standards and 
    Technology Organization (IEEE-ISTO) Printer Working Group (PWG) will 
    present June 4 and June 6, 2016 at the Drupa 2016 international printing
     conference on its new standard for communicating 3D print jobs and 
    status over a network and how open standards for protocols and file 
    formats can accelerate the development of 3D printing ecosystems.</p>

    <p>PWG IPP Working Group Co-Chair Paul Tykodi will speak in Hall 07a – 
    stand C41 of the 3D Fab + Print organization, a global community for 3D 
    printing and fabrication. His talk, “How Standards Can Help Foster
     Growth in the 3D Printing Environment”, will describe how the PWG is 
    extending its industry standard Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) to 
    support the needs of the 3D Printing environment and bring the existing 
    capabilities of IPP to 3D Printing environments.</p>

    <p>Tykodi will discuss how the PWG's Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) 
    attributes, values, and operations will facilitate simplified discovery 
    of 3D printer characteristics and capabilities, provide robust delivery 
    of 3D jobs, and enable in-band status monitoring of 3D printers and 
    print jobs. He also will discuss benefits of standardization to 
    manufacturers and software developers who can more easily support both 
    stand-alone network deployments and locally attached USB deployments 
    with a single technology.</p>

    <p>The PWG is a program of the IEEE Industry Standards and Technology 
    Organization (ISTO). Members include printer makers, print server 
    developers, operating system vendors, network operating system 
    developers, network connectivity vendors and print management 
    application providers. For more information see <a href="http://www.pwg.org/3d/">http://www.pwg.org/3d/</a>.</p>
