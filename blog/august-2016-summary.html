<p>The Printer Working Group August 2016 Face-to-Face meeting was held 
August 23-24, 2016 at Sharp Lab's facilities in Camas, Washington.
We discussed current and future liaisons with other groups, reviewed 
several drafts of in-progress specifications, discussed topics 
concerning printers / MFDs and Common Criteria (CC) testing and 
certification, and reviewed efforts to evolve the PWG Semantic Model. 
Below is a more detailed summary of the 
proceedings.</p>


    
<h2>PWG</h2>

<p>In the PWG Plenary, we discussed several topics relevant to the PWG 
membership community. First, an effort has begun to update the PWG
 Process document to version 4, to incorporate a number of policy 
documents that have been authored since the approval of the PWG Process 
3.0 process document, which was approved in 2006. Some discussion on how
 this should proceed, including some thoughts from Smith Kennedy and Ira
 McDonald concerning keeping some of the current policy documents as-is 
and using the Process v4 document as a "framework" document, was 
discussed. Also, a new whitepaper was proposed outlining the 
design principles and core design ethos of the PWG. This would be 
useful for both those active in PWG standards development, those 
implementing IPP in their products, and those considering IPP and 
wanting to understand why the PWG chose to structure its technologies 
the way that it does.</p>
<p>Following that, the Working Group chairs from the IPP WG, 
Semantic Model WG, and Imaging Device Security WG reviewed the status of
 their Working Group. Although the IDS working group was or is in 
hibernation, it has been awakened from its slumber to discuss some of 
the Common Criteria HCD Protection Profiles. We discussed the IPP
Everywhere Self Certification site and process, which is now live,
and two upcoming updates to the IPP Everywhere Self Certification
tools (1.0 Update 1 and 1.1). No printers have yet certified. Ira
described our liaison relationship with Trusted Computing Group.
Finally, Paul Tykodi discussed his experiences representing the PWG
at Drupa, where he presented a talk on 3D printing and IPP and the
value of open standards in 3D printing ecosystems. Paul also discussed
dialogs he had with representatives from Gartner about 3D printing.<br>
</p>
<h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Working Group</h2>

<p>We reviewed the IPP/1.1 RFC updates and the latest drafts of the 
IPP System Service, IPP 3D Printing Extensions, and the IPP Finishings 
2.1 specifications.</p>
<p>We noted the updates to IPP/1.1 (RFC 2910bis / 
RFC 2911bis) were either already approved or nearing approval. We 
reviewed the most recently updated draft 
of the IPP System Service, which continues to make good progress toward 
reaching
 a prototype state. We discussed the latest revision of the 
IPP 3D Extensions, which is in Prototype state. Finally, we 
reviewed the 
latest draft update to 5100.1 (a.k.a. "Finishings 2.1"), which has 
achieved Stable draft status and is in Working Group Last Call until 
September 6, 2016. A few editorial fixes were identified, which 
will be corrected in a follow-up Stable draft once the Working Group 
Last Call is complete.<br>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The next IPP Working Group conference call for IPP 3D Printing Extensions 
is on September 12, 2016 at 4pm ET / 1pm PT. The next IPP Working Group conference call for 2D printing topics 
is on September 19, 2016 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please subscribe to the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/ipp">ipp</a> mailing list for details.</p>
<h2>Imaging Device Security (IDS) Working Group</h2>
In the Imaging Device Security Working Group session, the attendees 
discussed the new Common Criteria Hardcopy Device (HCD) Protection 
Profile (PP) and the problems they have encountered with qualifying 
their products against this profile. We discussed issues such as the use
 of Solid State Drives, how requirements in the PP are being interpreted
 by the US and Japan, use of a true random number generator, and 
concerns about producing the entropy and other documentation required by
 this PP. We also discussed the US process for obtaining interpretations
 to PPs in general and how we can make that process more timely and more
 effective. Finally, we talked about the possibilities of forming a 
group of HCD vendors to assist the US is working issues with the new PP,
 the possibility of turning the PP into a PWG standard and the current 
status of turning this bilateral HCD PP between the US and Japan into an
 international PP.<br>
<br>
No future meeting was planned but we did discuss the possibility of 
having monthly IDS conference calls on these topics starting in 
September.<br>
<h2>Semantic Model (SM) Working Group

</h2>

<p>In the Semantic Model Working Group session, we discussed a range of 
topics. We first discussed the effort to encode a PWG Print Job 
Ticket into a 3MF 3D model file. Following that, there was a discussion 
of the effort to finalize the Semantic Model v2 (SM2). And 
finally, the work on Semantic Model v3 (SM3) was discussed.<br>
</p>
<p>The next Semantic Model Workgroup conference call will be at 3PM EDT, September 12, 2016.<br>
</p>


<h2>Next Face-to-Face Meeting</h2>

    
<p>We will hold our next PWG Face-to-Face meeting November 15-16, 2016 
hosted at Lexmark's facilities in Lexington, KY. Information on 
upcoming meetings as always is listed on the <a href="http://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/meetings.html">PWG's Meetings page</a>.<br>
