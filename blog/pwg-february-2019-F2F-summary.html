        target="_blank">February 2019 Virtual Face-to-Face Meeting</a>
      on February 14-15, 2019 via WebEx teleconferences. Representatives
      from Apple, Brother, Canon, Google, High North, HP Inc., Kyocera,
      Lexmark, Oki Data, TIC, TCS and Xerox attended the meetings.
      Attendees reviewed work in progress, including drafts of a number
      of in-progress specifications, and discussed liaisons with partner
      groups. Here is a summary of the proceedings. </p>
    <h2> PWG Plenary</h2>
    <p> In the PWG Plenary, we reviewed the overall state of the PWG,
      its programs and initiatives, and briefly discussed upcoming
      face-to-face meeting scheduling. We noted that <a
        href="https://www.pwg.org/printers" target="_blank"> there are
        now 355 printers certified </a> by the PWG's IPP Everywhere™
      Self Certification program, with more certifications believed to
      be in progress. Each active PWG workgroup (<a
        href="https://www.pwg.org/ids/" target="_blank">IDS Workgroup</a>
      and <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/" target="_blank">IPP
        Workgroup</a>) summarized their current status. Finally, we
      reviewed the status of our partners' work in Trusted Computing
      Group (TCG), IETF, Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup and
      Mopria Alliance.<br>

    <h2> Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup </h2>
    <p> On the first day, Ira McDonald and Mike Sweet surveyed the
      status of current IPP Workgroup work in progress. That initial
      session included an extended discussion of errata updates,
      deprecation and obsolescence of attributes that were judged to be
      non-interoperable and might be replaced. Other process and template
      changes were considered, including an "Obsolescence Rationale". An
      "IPP Design Patterns" document was again discussed, and it was
      suggested that we pursue that first in the GitHub "istopwg" wiki.
      We also discussed requiring prototyping and/or requesting intents
      to implement, to hopefully prevent specifying IPP extensions that
      are not practically implementable in the future. We concluded this
      segment after considering the changes to the website and the IPP
      Everywhere™ Self Certification submission process. This discussion
      ran over into the session where the current stable draft of
      IPP Everywhere v1.1 and IPP Everywhere Printer Self-Certification
      Manual v1.1 were to be reviewed, but these documents are stable
      and were not looked at again in this event. We briefly discussed
      the latest drafts of IPP 3D Printing Extensions v1.1 and PWG Safe
      G-Code. Both have completed IPP WG Last Call. IPP 3D Printing
      Extensions v1.1 will have its PWG Call for Objections in Q1 2019.
      PWG Safe G-Code will complete its PWG Last Call Feb. 28, 2019,
      with a PWG Formal Vote in Q1 2019. We then reviewed IPP System
      Service and briefly talked about the status of IPP Authentication
      Methods, which is in PWG Last Call.<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the second day, the IPP Workgroup sessions started with a
      presentation and update on IPP Job and Printer Extensions Set 2
      v2.0 (JPS2v2) by Smith Kennedy (HP Inc.) examining curiosities
      with IPP job states / job phases, and the semantics of IPP Proof
      Print, IPP Job Save and Reprint, and the newly proposed IPP Job
      Storage features. After a lively discussion critiquing the
      structure and content of PWG 5100.11-2010 (JPS2 v1), it was
      proposed that we obsolete all of PWG 5100.11-2010, and create a
      different document (or documents) that will keep what is worthy of
      keeping and obsolete what is not. Further discussion of this
      effort will occur at the next IPP WG teleconference on Feb. 28,
      2019. We reviewed the most recent draft of MFD Alerts v1.1,
      judging it to be ready for IPP WG Last Call. We briefly reviewed
      the most recent draft of IPP Document Object v1.1, which was also
      ready for IPP WG Last Call, and concluded with next steps.<br>

    <h2> Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup </h2>
    <p>On the morning of the second day, Alan Sukert led the IDS
      Workgroup session in a review of comments against the final draft
      of the proposed HCD PP v1.1 and the latest status on efforts to
      create an HCD international Technical Committee (iTC) tasked with
      transforming HCD PP v1.1 into an HCD collaborative PP (cPP). We
      also reviewed the comments against the latest drafts of the
      Essential Security Requirements (ESR) document and the Terms of
      Reference (ToR) documents, as well as the actual draft ESR itself,
      that are being created to be submitted to the Common Criteria
      Development Board (CCDB) for approval; once these two documents
      are approved by the CCDB we can formally initiate the HCD iTC. IDS
      members present provided some good additional comments against the
      ESR and ToR that will be submitted for consideration by the HCD TC
      at its next Conference Call in March 2019. Finally, we discussed
      the proposed contents and timelines for approval of the HCD PP
      v1.1 and an eventual HCD cPP v1.0. The IDS Workgroup will hold
      another Conference Call in March 2019 to review the proposed ToR
      document in more detail and discuss actions to initiate a dialogue
      to establish a liaison with the TCG.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Complete minutes will be available soon.<br>
