 2.4.0, which was announced on July 19, 2017, is now available for 
download. This release includes a much improved IPP dissector, which 
will benefit all who are inspecting IPP traffic in Wireshark. The new 
dissector properly labels IPP requests and responses, includes links to 
the corresponding responses and HTTP traffic. It also provides a much 
better presentation of the attributes within the IPP operation requests 
and responses, so the information is easier to read and navigate. This 
release should benefit all who spend time examining IPP traffic in 
Wireshark and those that use Wireshark's tools to gather and monitor IPP
 traffic.<br>
