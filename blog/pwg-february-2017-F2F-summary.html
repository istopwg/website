<p>The <a href="http://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/february-2017-sunnyvale.html">Printer Working Group February 2017 Face-to-Face meeting</a> was held
 February 14-15, 2017, at Apple's facilities in Sunnyvale, CA.
We discussed the future of the Semantic Model Workgroup efforts, 
reviewed specifications in or nearing completion of PWG Formal Vote, 
reviewed drafts of in-progress specifications, and discussed liaison 
status with a number of partners, including some partnerships relating 
to 3D printing. 
Below is a more detailed summary of the 
proceedings.</p>
<p><br>
</p>




    
<h2>PWG Plenary<br>
</h2>


<p>In the PWG Plenary, we reviewed the status of PWG workgroups and 
liaisons.&nbsp; The IDS workgroup is in semi-hibernation as discussions 
continue about some of the certification hurdles with the Common 
Criteria HCD Protection Profiles, with more activity expected before the
 April 2017 PWG face-to-face meeting.<br>
<br>
Paul Tykodi summarized the PWG's partnership and engagement with several
 3D printing related standards efforts, including ISO/IEC JTC1 Printing 
and Scanning Study Group, America Makes, and ANSI Additive Manufacturing
 Standardization Collaborative (AMSC), who are very interested in the 
value that IPP can provide to the 3D ecosystem.<br>
</p>

<h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Working Group</h2>

<p>The IPP Workgroup discussed the nearly complete IPP 3D Printing Extensions and IPP Finishings 
2.1 specifications, reviewed the latest drafts of the 
IPP System Service, and discussed a whitepaper contributed by HP.

</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>RFC 8010 and RFC 8011, which are updates to the venerable RFC 2910 
and 
RFC 2911 specifications that define IPP/1.1, have achieved "proposed 
standard" status in the IETF. These will both begin
 the IETF process to be advanced to full Internet Standard status. We 
reviewed the PWG Formal Vote results and status of IPP 3D Printing 
Extensions, whose vote completed on Feb. 10, and IPP Finishings 2.1, 
whose vote would complete on Feb. 17. Next steps were discussed for both
 documents. We 
reviewed the most recently updated draft 
of the IPP System Service, which continues to make good progress toward 
reaching
 a prototype state. And we discussed a whitepaper contributed by HP that
 proposed some extensions to IPP to better support per-user print policy
 detection and application, which triggered some lively discussion. A 
new draft will be posted soon to continue the dialog on this subject. 
Finally, the next steps for IPP 3D were discussed.</p>

<p>
</p><h2>Semantic Model (SM) Working Group

</h2>


<p>The current Semantic Model Workgoup charter requires that the 
Semantic Model reflect additions and changes implemented by the IPP 
workgroup. With the demonstrated ability of the IPP workgroup to 
generate semantic models automatically from IPP Registry data, and the 
lack of resources in the SM Workgroup, the task of generating needed 
models was transferred to the IPP Workgroup. Further, because the lack 
of prototype data has not allowed the workgroup to proceed with the 
JDFMAP document progress toward approval as a candidate standard, it was
 decided to seek to publish this very useful specification as a "Best 
Practices" document.&nbsp; With the chartered projects of SM workgroup 
so resolved, it was decided to put the SM Workgroup into hibernation 
until such time as needs and resources require its reactivation.</p>

<h2>Next Meeting</h2>


    
<p>We will hold our next PWG Face-to-Face meeting April 24-25, 2017 as a "virtual F2F" event. Information on 
upcoming meetings is provided on the <a href="http://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/meetings.html">PWG's Meetings page</a>.</p>
