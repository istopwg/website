    <p> The PWG held its <a href="https://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/august-2019-virtual.html" target="_blank">August 2019 Virtual Face-to-Face Meeting</a>
      on August 28-30, 2019 via WebEx teleconferences. Representatives
      from Apple, Canon, Google, High North, HP Inc., Kyocera,
      Lexmark, Qualcomm, TIC, TCS and Xerox attended the meetings.
      Attendees reviewed work in progress, including drafts of a number
      of in-progress specifications, and discussed liaisons with partner
      groups. Here is a summary of the proceedings. </p>
    <h2> PWG Plenary</h2>
    <p> In the PWG Plenary, we reviewed the overall state of the PWG,
      its programs and initiatives, and briefly discussed upcoming
      face-to-face meeting scheduling. We noted that <a href="https://www.pwg.org/printers" target="_blank"> there are
        now 412 printers certified</a> under the PWG's IPP Everywhere™
      Self Certification program, with more certifications believed to
      be in the works. We discussed the PWG Steering Committee's 
activities and initiatives, including PR efforts and recently approved 
documents. Each active PWG workgroup (<a href="https://www.pwg.org/ids/" target="_blank">IDS Workgroup</a>
      and <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/" target="_blank">IPP
        Workgroup</a>) summarized their current status. Finally, we
      reviewed the status of our partners' work in Trusted Computing
      Group (TCG), IETF, Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup, Mopria Alliance and 3MF Consortium.<br>

    </p>
    <h2> Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup </h2>
    <p> On the first day, Ira McDonald and Mike Sweet surveyed the
      status of current IPP Workgroup work in progress. We then moved to
 a review of the latest revision of IPP
      Everywhere™ v1.1 and IPP Everywhere Self Certification v1.1. After
 a break, we then completed a review of the latest draft of IPP Job and 
Printer Extensions Set 3 v2.0 (JPS3v2.0), picking up where we left off 
in one of the previous teleconferences. After another break, we began a 
review of IPP Production Printing Extensions v2.0 (PPX).<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the second day, after the IDS Workgroup session, the IPP 
Workgroup sessions started with a
      review of IPP Encrypted Jobs and Documents v1.0, which hadn't 
received much attention recently. Several additions and modifications 
were proposed, and it was suggested that prototyping might begin this 
fall. We then reviewed the latest draft of IPP System Service, which is 
in PWG Last Call. After a break, we concluded our review of IPP 
Production Printing Extensions v2.0, since an updated draft of IPP 
Enterprise Printing Extensions v2.0 wasn't yet available for review.</p>
<p>On the third day, we began with an Errata status summary, and then 
Paul Tykodi led a discussion on the status of the PWG's 3D Printing 
related liaisons and outreach efforts. After our lunch break, we held a 
3D Printing Metadata BoF, which unfortunately didn't manage to attract 
more attendees. We concluded with next steps.<br>

    </p>
    <h2> Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup </h2>
    
    <p>At the start of the second day, Alan Sukert led the IDS Workgroup
 status and progress discussion. NIAP has indicated that it will not 
accept any changes to HCD PP version 1.0, so HCD PP v1.1 will not be 
approved or published. The consensus in the group was that this was 
actually a positive development in that the work we did HCD PP v1.1 
won't have to first go through NIAP review. The draft HCD PP v1.1 will 
move directly to be the basis for the first draft of HCD cPP 1.0. <br>
</p>
<p>We then discussed the status of the HCD Technical Community (TC) 
transition towards becoming an HCD international TC (iTC), which will 
create the group that will be authoring the HCD cPP 1.0. The HCD WG is 
working very closely with the CCMC to obtain CCMC approval before the 
upcoming HCD TC Face-to-Face Meeting which will be held Sep 26th in 
Singapore. We then discussed issues associated with the transition from 
an HCD TC to an HCD iTC and what the content of an HCD cPP version 1.0 
might be. The upcoming HCD TC Face-to-Face on Sep 26th will cover both 
technical issues regarding the HCD TC and cPP, and issues in setting up 
the HCD iTC. Some time was spent discussing scope and additional 
requirements to be added to the HCD cPP 1.0 beyond the state of the 
draft HCD PP v1.1.</p>
<p>Ira provided a status update on the additions he is making to the next revision of PWG Hardcopy Device Security Guidelines.</p>
