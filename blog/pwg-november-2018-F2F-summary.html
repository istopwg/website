    <p> The PWG held its <a

        target="_blank">November 2018 Virtual Face-to-Face Meeting</a>
      on November 14-15, 2018 via WebEx teleconferences. Representatives
      from Apple, Canon, Google, High North, HP Inc., Lexmark, Oki,
      Ricoh, TIC, TCS and Xerox attended the meetings. Attendees
      reviewed work in progress, including drafts of a number of
      in-progress specifications, and discussed liaisons with partner
      groups. Here is a summary of the proceedings. </p>
    <h2> PWG Plenary </h2>
    <p> In the PWG Plenary, we reviewed the overall state of the PWG,
      its programs and initiatives, and briefly discussed upcoming
      face-to-face meeting scheduling. We noted that <a
        href="https://www.pwg.org/printers" target="_blank"> there are
        now 355 printers certified </a> by the PWG's IPP Everywhereâ„¢
      Self Certification program, with more certifications believed to
      be in progress. Each active PWG workgroup (<a
        href="https://www.pwg.org/ids/" target="_blank">IDS Workgroup</a>
      and <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/" target="_blank">IPP
        Workgroup</a>) summarized their current status. Finally, we
      reviewed the status of our partners' work in Trusted Computing
      Group (TCG), IETF, Mopria Alliance, Linux Foundation OpenPrinting
      Workgroup, and a quick summary of our 3D liaisons. Xerox's Jeremy
      Reitz, acting in his role as Mopria Alliance liaison to the PWG,
      presented "Mopria Overview 2018".<br>

    <h2> Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup </h2>
    <p> On the first day, Ira McDonald and Mike Sweet surveyed the
      status of current IPP Workgroup work in progress. We then reviewed
      the most recent draft of IPP Everywhere v1.1 and IPP Everywhere
      Printer Self-Certification Manual v1.1. The group considered
      several topics, including changes to the certification process to
      align with some proposed changes to the PWG website, and possibly
      listing additional attributes in v1.1 as "Recommended", to begin
      the process of incorporating them into a future major revision of
      IPP Everywhere. We also heard feedback that the specification can
      be hard for those unfamiliar with the PWG specifications ecosystem
      to read as a single document, and considered a few ideas about how
      to make it easier for newcomers to determine what they needed to
      implement, why various attributes are required, and whether
      certain "feature verticals" that might be required or optional
      could be certified as well.<br>
    </p>
    <p> After a break, Paul Tykodi reviewed the PWG's 3D liaisons in
      more detail. Paul provided an overview of the recent work by AMSC,
      ISO/IEC JTC 1 3D Printing and Scanning Study Group, and others,
      and what next steps he and the PWG might want to take. We then
      shifted to review the latest drafts of IPP 3D Printing Extensions
      and PWG Safe G-Code, both of which are in the prototype stage and
      should be ready for last call in Q1 2019. Some additions for
      "material-type" IPP 3D Printing Extensions may be added before
      last call to cover some concrete printing applications. We then
      reviewed the latest draft of IPP System Service, evaluating a
      number of aspects of system subscriptions and notifications and
      how to make sure support for monitoring the System as well as its
      Printer objects might be best handled. We finished the day with a
      review of the most recent draft of IPP Authentication Methods, in
      which considerations of SAML were added. It is nearing completion.<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the second day, the IPP Workgroup sessions started with a
      presentation by Smith Kennedy (HP Inc.) examining desired use
      cases and the issues driving a revision of JPS2 that would include
      a new set of IPP attributes to better support stored jobs. JPS2's
      "job-save-disposition" was earlier judged to be incapable of
      supporting the requested use cases without breaking backward
      compatibility with earlier systems. We then reviewed the most
      recent draft of MFD Alerts v1.1, discussing how to resolve a
      number of issues with keyword naming without causing compatibility
      issues. We concluded the day's sessions with a short review of the
      most recent draft of IPP Document Object v1.1, and next steps.<br>

    <h2> Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup </h2>
    <p> On the morning of the second day, Alan Sukert led the IDS
      Workgroup session with a review of changes to HCD PP v1.1 proposed
      at the Hardcopy Device Technical Committee face-to-face meeting
      held in Amsterdam on October 29, 2018, and status of efforts to
      create an HCD international Technical Committee (iTC) tasked with
      transforming the HCD PP v1.1 into an HCD collaborative PP (cPP).
      We discussed questions about TLS 1.1 and 1.3, whether to consider
      print servers as well as output devices, including Wi-Fi, and ways
      of managing various procedural issues. Ira suggested that the IDS
      Workgroup pursue some type of liaison activity with the TCG like
      what we are doing now with the HCD TC. The IDS Workgroup will hold
      a special meeting in December 2018 to discuss actions to initiate
      a dialogue with the TCG, and hold a general IDS Workgroup Meeting
      in January 2019 to review the ESR and TOR for the proposed HCD
      iTC, review the final HCD PP v1.1 changes, and discuss the liaison
      with the TCG.<br>
