<p> The PWG held its <a href="https://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/february-2020-virtual.html" target="_blank">February 2020 Virtual Face-to-Face Meeting</a>
      on February 5-6, 2020 via WebEx teleconferences. Representatives
      from Canon, Google, High North, HP Inc., Kyocera,
Lakeside Robotics,      Lexmark, Ricoh, TIC, TCS and Xerox attended the meetings.
      Attendees reviewed work in progress, including drafts of a number
      of in-progress specifications, and discussed liaisons with partner
      groups. Here is a summary of the proceedings. </p>

    
<h2> PWG Plenary</h2>

    
<p> As in previous PWG Face to Face events, the PWG Chair presented the Plenary.
      We reviewed the overall state of the PWG,
      its programs and initiatives, and briefly discussed upcoming
      face-to-face meeting scheduling. We noted that <a href="https://www.pwg.org/printers" target="_blank"> there are
        now 412 printers certified</a> under the PWG's IPP Everywhere™
      Self Certification program, with more certifications believed to
      be in progress from multiple vendors. We discussed the PWG Steering Committee's 
activities and initiatives, including its 2020 goals, the status of Process 4.0, PR efforts, recently approved 
documents, process document updates, the website migration initiative, 
and "toolset" alternatives for producing specifications. Each active PWG
 workgroup (<a href="https://www.pwg.org/ids/" target="_blank">IDS Workgroup</a>
      and <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/" target="_blank">IPP
        Workgroup</a>) summarized their current status. Finally, we
      reviewed the status of our partners' work in Trusted Computing
      Group (TCG), IETF, Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup, Mopria Alliance and 3MF Consortium.<br>

    </p>

    
<h2> Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup </h2>

    
<p> On the first day, Ira McDonald (IPP WG Co-Chair) and Mike Sweet 
(IPP WG Secretary) surveyed the
      status of current IPP Workgroup works in progress, noting that IPP
 Transaction-Based Printing Extensions v1.1 and IPP Label Printing 
Extensions v1.0 are both in IPP WG Last Call, ending on February 13, 
2020. We then briefly
 reviewed the status of IPP
      Everywhere™ and IPP Everywhere Self Certification, 
noting that a beta release of the IPP Everywhere Self Certification Test
 Suite 1.0 Update 4 was recently announced and made available, and 
encouraged attendees to test this in the next two weeks. After
 a break, we discussed the status of IPP Production Printing Extensions v2.0. Following that, 
we began a review of the latest 
draft of IPP Driverless Printing Extensions v2.0, that had received a 
number of updates. That review didn't complete, so the group committed 
to reviewing it further the next day. We 
finished the day discussing Job Accounting with IPP v1.0.<br>
    </p>

    
<p>On the second day, after the IDS Workgroup session, the IPP 
Workgroup sessions started with a
      review of IPP Encrypted Jobs and Documents v1.0. We then resumed 
our review of IPP Driverless Printing Extensions v2.0, still not 
completing a full review but making substantive progress, and committed 
to conclude the review of this revision in the next IPP WG 
teleconference. After a much needed break, 
Paul Tykodi (IPP WG Co-Chair and lead PWG 3D Printing Liaison) led a 
discussion on the status of the PWG's 3D Printing 
related liaisons and outreach efforts, noting that we were in the 
process of establishing a liaison with ITC TC171 and some upcoming 
engagements with ACI and presentations at Drupa 2020. We concluded the 
IPP WG
 sessions with next steps.<br>

    </p>

    
<h2> Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup </h2>

    
    
<p>At the start of the second day, Alan Sukert (outgoing PWG Vice-Chair 
and IDS WG Chair) led the IDS Workgroup
 status and progress discussion. We went through the minutes of the  HCD
 Technical Community (TC) Conference Calls held recently, including the 
status of the initiative to approve generation of an HCD international 
TC (iTC) and some thoughts on what the content of HCD collaborative 
Protection Profile (cPP) v1.0 should include. Our hope is that the vote 
will be done before the CCUF Workshop Mar 15-17 in Burlington MA. Ira 
then went through his slides on TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 that are part of the
 meeting slides. Ira then led us through the changes made in the PDF rev
 version of the 1/20/2020 draft of the PWG Hardcopy Device Security 
Guidelines v1.0. Alan indicated that he is retiring from Xerox on April 
1st so this is his last IDS Face-to-Face Meeting, and the other 
attendees thanked him for his efforts. We wrapped up with next steps.<br>
