<h2>PWG</h2>





<p>In the PWG Plenary, we reviewed the state of the PWG, including the 
results of the PWG officer election, upcoming events, and projects 
hosted on the <a href="https://github.com/istopwg">PWG GitHub site</a>.
 We briefly covered the status of each working group, noting that the 
Imaging 
Device Security (IDS) working group will hold periodic meetings as part 
of its new role to review and discuss issues implementing the new HCD 
Protection Profile and other HCD standards. We noted that there were now
 206 printers certified under the IPP Everywhereâ„¢ Self Certification 
program, and that more were purported to be on the way. We noted a shift
 in the CUPS Project's license and discussed whether it was appropriate 
for the PWG to mirror that shift. We 
discussed our liaison relationships with Trusted Computing Group (TCG), 
Mobile Platform Workgroup (MPWG),&nbsp; 
IETF, Mopria, ISO/IEC JTC1, ISO TC 130 and AMSC. We had an open 
discussion about new work areas and unaddressed needs.<br>
</p>


<h2>Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup</h2>

<p>In the IDS WG session, we reviewed the NIAP direction implementing 
the changes to NIST SP800-131A and NIST SP800-56B. We also discussed 
password requirements in the HCD Protection Profile and in the NIST SP 
800-171. Updates to the HCD PP are planned by the HCD TC, and the 
planned changes were reviewed.<br>

<h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup




    
</h2>



<p>In the IPP WG sessions, Ira McDonald 
presented the latest draft of 
the IPP System Service specification. Smith 
Kennedy presented the latest drafts of "IPP 
Get-User-Printer-Attributes Operation", "IPP Presets" and "IPP 
Authentication Methods" white papers. IPP Get-User-Printer-Attributes 
and IPP Presets entered IPP WG Last Call soon after the F2F event.</p>

<p>Future work was also discussed, including enhancements to the PWG's 
"ippsample" project in its Github site and collaboration on projects 
with the Linux OpenPrinting team.<br>
