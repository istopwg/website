<h2> PWG Plenary</h2>



    
<p> The PWG sessions began on the first day with the PWG Chair presenting the PWG Plenary.
      We reviewed the overall state of the PWG,
      its programs and initiatives, and briefly discussed upcoming
      face-to-face meeting scheduling. We noted that <a href="https://www.pwg.org/printers" target="_blank"> there are currently 412 printers certified</a>
 under the PWG's IPP Everywhere™
      Self Certification program, with
 more certifications in progress from multiple vendors with the IPP 
Everywhere™v1.1 Update 1 self certification test suite recently approved. We discussed the PWG Steering Committee's 
activities and initiatives, including its 2020 goals, the status of 
Process 4.0 and updated policies, public relations efforts, recently 
approved 
documents, and process document updates. Officers from the <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ids/" target="_blank">IDS Workgroup</a>
      and <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/" target="_blank">IPP
        Workgroup</a> summarized their Workgroup's current status, and 
PWG Liaison Officers reported on the status of our partners' work in 
Trusted Computing
      Group (TCG), IETF, Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup, Mopria
 Alliance, ISO JTC1 WG12, and INCITS.<br>

<h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup </h2>



    
<p> On the first day, Ira McDonald (IPP WG Co-Chair) and Mike Sweet 
(IPP WG Secretary) surveyed the
      status of current IPP Workgroup works in progress, noting that 
there is still the intention to update the charter in 2020. IPP 
Everywhere v1.1 and 
IPP Everywhere Self Certification v1.1 are both approved, and IPP 
Everywhere v1.1 Update 1 self-certification tool sets were recently 
approved. Aveek Basu presented a status update of the Linux OpenPrinting
 
Workgroup's Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2020 projects in progress. 
After
 a break, we discussed the IPP INFRA and Cloud Proxy Registration 
initiative, then reviewed the latest draft of Job Accounting with IPP 
v1.0, 
and discussed user identity. With some extra time available, we had a 
productive discussion on the IPP Everywhere Value Proposition, where we 
talked about opportunities for new areas for testing, marketing / 
evangelization, and other vectors of effort to pursue.<br>
    </p>



    
<p>On the second day, after the IDS Workgroup session, the group 
briefly discussed the latest draft of IPP Encrypted Jobs and Documents 
v1.0 and prototyping efforts. We then reviewed the latest draft of IPP 
Enterprise Printing Extensions v2.0. 
Significant changes were made to the latest draft including the new Job 
Proof and Suspend feature and its "proof-copies" attribute. A number of 
grammatical issues were identified to be changed in the next draft, as 
well as a problem with changes to how the "job-password" attribute was 
defined, which will be backed out. The document is now targeting Q1 
2021, and the editor pledged to make a new draft available soon to 
restart review and make progress.</p>

<p>On the third day, the  IPP 
Workgroup started with a
      review of IPP Production Printing Extensions v2.0, which is (or 
was)
nearing completion. We then discussed a feature issue pertaining to how a
 Client can express intent to specify the orientation and position of 
the Media Sheet on roll media.  The group discussed whether the 
solution for that might best be solved by new IPP attributes or by 
additional keywords for "imposition-template", which is now defined in 
Production Printing Extensions v2.0. We then reviewed the latest 
proposal to how the new "print-quality-col" Job Template attribute and 
its members might be defined in the next revision of IPP Driverless 
Printing Extensions
 v2.0. Consensus was reached and documented on a wiki page on the PWG's 
ippsample GitHub project. A new draft will be posted soon with this new 
definition.</p>

<p>After a break, we discussed the PWG's 3D Printing liaisons and the 
guidance we will be providing to our partners. We started with a 
discussion of a nascent effort to create a 3D Print Protection Profile, 
similar to the HCD PP being worked on by members of the IDS WG. We then
continued to discuss how to bridge the "perception gaps" between what 
IPP 3D 
provides and what the industry is asking for, and we discussed updating 
our slides and topic page with more interaction models and other 
diagrams to paint a more complete picture. We concluded the 
IPP WG
 sessions with next steps.<br>

    </p>


    
<h2> Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup </h2>


    
    
<p>At the start of the second day, Alan Sukert (IDS WG Chair) led
 the IDS Workgroup
 status and progress discussion. 4. Went through the 
minutes of the HCD iTC meetings held on 5/28/2020, 6/11/2020, 6/25/2020,
 7/9/2020, 7/23/2020 and 8/6/2020. The first internal draft of the HCD 
cPP was sent out for HCD iTC review on 7/21 and it received 46 comments.
 The group briefly reviewed and discussed the comment review process. 
Then we discussed what Conformance Claim what would 
be used for the cPP. This issue was the main topic in two months' worth
 
of iTC meetings. The core disagreement involved whether to include 
Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) for EAL2, which was desired by 
some because many European countries require EAL2 certifications, or 
whether the cPP should be limited to SARs for EAL1. Consensus in the iTC
 wasn't achieved, so it was put to a vote. The results of the vote 
showed a 2:1 preference for limiting it to EAL1. Alan then reviewed the 
HCD cPP timetable.</p>

<p>The group then shifted to a further discussion of the new ETSI EN 303
 645 V2.1.1 (2020-06) Cyber Security for Consumer Internet of Things 
Standard. Many network connectable printers targeting home or SMB 
markets would seem to clearly fall within the scope of this standard. 
Next, Ira presented a set of slides on his proposed schedule and content
 for his HCD Security Guidelines document. The group concluded with a 
discussion involving the NIAP Cybersecurity Framework, one of the 
standards activities Ira had mentioned in his discussion over a year 
ago. Al had analyzed this framework for Xerox in Sep 2019 and believed 
it would be valuable for the group to revisit the subject. The meeting 
concluded with
next steps.<br>
