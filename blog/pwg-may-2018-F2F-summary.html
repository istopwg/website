    <p>The PWG held its May 2018 Face-to-Face meeting May 15-17, 2018 at
      the Wild Palms Hotel in Sunnyvale, California. This event was held
      in collaboration with <a
href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting">Linux



        Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup</a>.&nbsp; Sessions were
      presented by both organizations over the event's 3 days.
      Representatives from Apple, Artifex, Canon, Canonical, Google,
      High North, HP Inc., IBM, Lexmark, Microsoft, Oki, Red Hat, Ricoh,
      TIC, TCS and Xerox attended the meetings. Attendees present in
      person and on the phone discussed liaisons with one another and
      other groups, and reviewed work in progress, including drafts of a
      number of in-progress specifications. Here is a summary of the
      proceedings.</p>

    <h2>PWG Plenary<br>
    </h2>
    <p>In the PWG Plenary, we reviewed the overall state of the PWG and
      the status of its programs. We briefly discussed upcoming
      face-to-face meeting planning, noting that attendance has been a
      concern in the past for the events later in the year. We
      considered both virtual and in-person meetings, and noted the need
      for a survey to poll members and attendees for the viability and
      timing of another in-person face-to-face meeting. We noted that <a
        href="https://www.pwg.org/printers" target="_blank">there are
        now 272 printers certified</a> under the PWG's IPP Everywhere™
      Self Certification program (it was 206 at the start of the day!),
      with more purported to be on the way.<br>
    </p>
    <p>We also reviewed the status of the <a
        href="https://www.pwg.org/ids/">IDS Workgroup</a> and the <a
        href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/">IPP Workgroup</a>, noting that
      the Imaging Device Security (IDS) working group members have
      recently attended HCD TC meetings and that Paul Tykodi had
      recently attended the RAPID + TCT Conference as a representative
      of the PWG. It was observed that the PWG has recently sent a
      request to advance RFC 8010 and RFC 8011 to full Internet Standard
      status, which seems to be moving forward. Finally, we discussed
      our liaison relationships with Trusted Computing Group (TCG),
      IETF, Mopria, AMSC, ISO/IEC JTC1 3D Printing and Scanning Study
      Group, possible collaboration with ISO TC 171 SC2, and possible
      collaboration with IEEE P3030.</p>

    <h2>Linux OpenPrinting</h2>
    <p>In the Linux OpenPrinting sessions on the first day, Ira McDonald
      led a review the status of the Linux OpenPrinting project and its
      efforts, and reviewed the current major issues affecting printing
      on Linux and other open source operating systems.&nbsp; Michael
      Vrhel discussed the latest updates to Ghostscript and MuPDF and
      reviewed why one might choose one over the other. Mike Sweet of
      Apple reviewed the state of CUPS and outlined some of the upcoming
      enhancements to that system, including a significant license
      change, driver deprecation, and Print Applications coming in CUPS
      2.3. Till Kamppeter of Canonical discussed the latest enhancement
      to the "cups-filters" and "cups-browsed" projects, which support
      technologies that have been removed from the core CUPS
      distributions. Lastly, Aveek Basu of Lexmark discussed the Google
      Summer of Code (GSoC) projects that Linux OpenPrinting has active
      for 2018, and noted the contributions made by PWG members to
      guiding the students' work.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup </h2>
    <p>In the IPP WG sessions on the first day, we discussed 3D printing
      related topics, continuing the liaison status updates from Paul
      Tykodi, that led into a discussion of higher level file formats
      such as 3D PDF, and also ISO Step-NC. We then reviewed the latest
      drafts of IPP 3D Printing Extensions v1.1 and PWG Safe G-Code,
      with contributions and comments from Kris Iverson of Microsoft.
      The consensus was that the PWG is making good progress, and all
      are hoping these documents and the prototyping work contributed by
      Mike Sweet can help to further simplify and empower the client /
      printer interactions between clients and desktop 3D printers.<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the second day, Ira led a status review, and then Mike Sweet
      performed a sample code demonstration, showing off the support of
      Shared Infrastructure Extensions support in "ippproxy" and other
      tools. Next, Mike Sweet and Ira McDonald led a review of the
      latest draft of IPP System Service. We reviewed the entire latest
      draft, and the group believes it is making good progress toward a
      stable draft, though a number of relatively minor changes were
      identified. Following lunch, we reviewed the latest draft of IPP
      Encrypted Jobs and Documents, in which we discussed the recently
      published "eFail" vulnerabilities to S/MIME and PGP. We briefly
      discussed the nature of those vulnerabilities and some
      alternatives, then decided that none of us were qualified to
      propose any alternatives. Smith volunteered to contribute some use
      case topology diagrams to keep the effort scope on track, and the
      group agreed to set this effort aside to wait for mitigations from
      the S/MIME and PGP communities. Smith Kennedy then led a review of
      the latest draft of the Job Reprint Password IPP Registration
      document, where the group noted a number of editorial and other
      issues. Finally, Mike Sweet led a review of the changes in the
      latest draft of IPP Everywhere v1.1 and IPP Everywhere Self
      Certification v1.1, when we also discussed some updates to the IPP
      Everywhere Self Certification portal page.<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the afternoon of the third day, Mike Sweet led a review of the
      latest draft of the "How to Use the Internet Printing Protocol"
      mini-book, aimed at introducing newcomers to IPP concepts and
      usage. Next, Smith Kennedy led a review of the latest draft of IPP
      Authentication Methods, which contained some clarifications in the
      OAuth2 section including a second "hybrid OAuth2 / HTTP Digest"
      system (discussed and abandoned), as well as new content replacing
      a number of lingering placeholders in the earlier drafts
      concerning certificate management and life cycles. Finally, next
      steps were considered.<br>

    <h2>Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup</h2>
    <p>The IDS Workgroup had a session on the morning of the third day,
      where notable developments in the HCD TC meetings and face-to-face
      event in Trondheim, Norway, were reviewed. A number of new
      requirements and changes were discussed in detail. There was
      general agreement with the recommendations as to what changes
      should go into the planned Version 1.1 “minor” update to the HCD
      Protection Profile (PP) that is planned for November 2018, and
      what changes should go into the next major update to the HCD PP.
      Those present at the meeting supported the consensus of the HCD TC
      that the TC’s next step should be to get the Common Criteria
      Development Board to approve the formation of a HCD international
      TC (iTC) from the HCD TC so that the next major update to the HCD
      PP would be an HCD collaborative PP (cPP).</p>

    <h2>Next PWG Face-to-Face Meeting</h2>
    <p>The PWG is still considering the exact time and location for its
      next face-to-face event. A poll will be constructed to solicit
      input from the membership. A link to that survey will be added to
      the <a href="http://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/meetings.html">PWG



        Meetings page</a>, where information on upcoming meetings is
      listed.<br>
