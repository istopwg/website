    <title>Summary of August 2015 Face-to-Face Meeting</title>

  <body>
    <p>The Printer Working Group recently held a face-to-face meeting on August 11 and 12, 2015 in Camas, WA. We discussed current and future liaison's with other standards groups and reviewed several drafts of in-progress specifications. What follows is a summary of the proceedings.</p>

    <h2>3D Printing BOF</h2>
    <p>During the 3D Printing BOF we discussed material specification and 3D file formats. We also reviewed the most recent version of the IPP extension white paper.</p>
    <p>Conference calls will be scheduled during open time slots. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/3d-printing">3d-printing</a> mailing list for details.</p>

    <h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup</h2>
    <p>We reviewed several in-progress documents and started the PWG Last Call of the IPP 2.0 specification. The IPP/1.1 RFC updates are waiting on action by the IETF.</p>
    <p>During the review of the IPP System Service specification, we decided that the "configured-printers" collection will contain the complete set of attributes identified in the LDAP Printer Schema. We also decided to add a new Set-Default-Printer operation that explicitly sets the service returned by the Get-Printer-Attributes request for legacy clients.</p>
    <p>The next Internet Printing Protocol conference call is on August 31, 2015 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/ipp">ipp</a> mailing list for details.</p>

    <h2>Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup</h2>
    <p>We reviewed the TNC Binding specification and prototyping, HCD TC Protection Profile status, and future tasks of the workgroup. After review, the PWG Last Call was started for the TNC Binding specification.</p>
    <p>The HCD TC Protection Profile is nearing completion with only a handful of issues remaining to be resolved. It should be published in September.</p>
    <p>Finally, we discussed the future of the IDS workgroup, with the consensus to complete the formal approval of the HCD-TNC Binding specification and then move the workgroup to inactive status until new work is identified. A new charter will be created reflecting the change in status, with the Semantic Model workgroup taking responsibility for management of the security schema.</p>
    <p>The next Imaging Device Security conference call is on August 31, 2015 at 2pm ET / 11am PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/ids">ids</a> mailing list for details.</p>

    <h2>Semantic Model (SM) Workgroup</h2>
    <p>We discussed prototyping efforts for the JDFMAP specification, reviewed Pete Zehler's evolution of the PWG Semantic Model diagram, and discussed the role and future of the Semantic Model workgroup. A JDFMAP prototype could be developed based on the OpenPrinting JTAPI library.</p>
    <p>While discussing the role of the workgroup, there was consensus that maintenance of the Semantic Model XML schema is a primary project for the workgroup and served as an aide for interchange and interoperability with other protocols and formats, such as JDF. However, work on the Semantic Model 3.0 documents will be suspended until such time as authors are identified to develop formal white papers which can go through the formal approval process. The workgroup will develop an updated charter that details the schema maintenance and completion of the JDFMAP standards process, and that charter will go through the formal approval process.</p>
    <p>The next Semantic Model conference call is on August 24, 2015 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/sm3">sm3</a> mailing list for details.</p>

    <h2>Next Meeting</h2>
    <p>We will tentatively hold our next meeting on November 3-5, 2015 in Lexington, KY hosted at Lexmark's facilities.</p>
