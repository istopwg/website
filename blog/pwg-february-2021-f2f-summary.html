        target="_blank">February 2021 Virtual Face-to-Face Meeting</a>
      on February 9-11, 2021 via Webex teleconferences. Representatives
      from Canon, Google, High North, HP Inc., Konica Minolta, Kyocera
      Document Solutions, Lakeside Robotics, Lexmark, Microsoft,
      Qualcomm, Pharos, Ricoh, TIC, TCS and Xerox attended the meetings,
      among others. Attendees reviewed work in progress, including
      drafts of a number of in-progress specifications, and discussed
      liaisons with partner groups. Here is a summary of the
      proceedings. </p>
    <h2> </h2>
    <h2> PWG Plenary</h2>
    <p> The F2F event began with the PWG Plenary session, which had a
      reduced scope to limit the presentation time. The PWG Chair began
      with the new PWG Antitrust Policy, which was presented at the
      start of each session at this F2F, and will be presented at the
      start of all PWG teleconferences and F2F sessions going forward.
      We then paused to note the passing of Ron Bergman, a dedicated
      original member and contributor to many PWG specifications and
      efforts. The PWG Chair then reviewed the overall state of the PWG,
      its programs and initiatives, and briefly discussed upcoming
      face-to-face meeting scheduling. We noted that <a
        href="https://www.pwg.org/printers/" target="_blank"> there are
        currently 629 printers certified</a> under the PWG's IPP
      Everywhere™ Self Certification program. We discussed the PWG
      Steering Committee's activities and initiatives, including
      progress on Process 4.0, new policies, and recently approved
      documents. Officers from the <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ids/"
        target="_blank">IDS Workgroup</a> and <a
        href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/" target="_blank">IPP Workgroup</a>
      briefly summarized their Workgroup's status, and PWG Liaison
      Officers also briefly reported on the status of our partners' work
      in Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup, Mopria Alliance, ISO
      JTC1 WG12, and INCITS. <br>

    <h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup </h2>
    <p> On the first day, Ira McDonald (IPP WG Co-Chair) and Mike Sweet
      (IPP WG Secretary) surveyed the status of current IPP Workgroup
      works in progress. The&nbsp; IPP Everywhere v1.1 Update 2
      self-certification tool set was recently approved. The Job
      Accounting with IPP v1.0 was formally approved on February 5. The
      status of IPP Driverless Printing Extensions v2.0 was briefly
      discussed, since a new draft was not yet published and ready for
      review.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The IPP WG moved on to the Evolution of IPP/2.0 and IPP
      Everywhere session, where they considered what that means from a
      versioning point of view and related issues. Some possible
      solutions to issues with the current IPP Everywhere v1.1 test
      suite when testing streaming printers were discussed, and how that
      might impact certification timing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>After a break, we discussed the IPP INFRA Cloud Proxy
      Registration initiative and related work plans. The scope of the
      work is likely to trigger an update to IPP Shared Infrastructure
      Extensions (PWG 5100.18) and IPP System Service (PWG 5100.22).
      There was much discussion and we didn't complete the topic on that
      first day, so we made plans to continue the discussion the next
      day once some schedule changes were made.<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the second day, after the IDS Workgroup session and a break,
      the group continued the discussion about IPP INFRA Cloud Proxy
      Registration. We discussed Local Printing, an expanded set of use
      cases and topologies for release printing, Cloud Scan support, and
      the need to project more portions of existing SNMP MIBs into the
      IPP space. We didn't get to IPP Finishings v2.2, but Smith Kennedy
      informed the group that the next step was to review the normative
      requirements in the specification and decide on whether the new
      revision was going to be a minor revision (v2.2) or a major one
      (v3.0).<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the third day, the IPP Workgroup started with a review of IPP
      Enterprise Printing Extensions v2.0. The group discussed the
      "job-password-repertoire" and "job-password-length-supported" that
      were registered several years ago, and proposed some updates to
      those. The group committed to continuing the review in the next
      IPP WG teleconference after the F2F.<br>
    </p>
    <p>After a break, Paul Tykodi led a review of the PWG's 3D Printing
      liaisons and the guidance we will be providing to our partners. We
      discussed the competition between different standards and
      proprietary solutions, and the need to increase the visibility of
      IPP 3D, particularly in comparison to MT Connect, which is a
      low-level process-oriented machine control protocol. 3D Scanning
      and work on an IPP 3D Scan specification was discussed. Since
      security and privacy are being discussed more in the 3D Printing /
      Additive Manufacturing community, evangelizing the existing robust
      security facilities in IPP could help advertise its value. We
      discussed the value in having an article written to articulate
      IPP's value to 3D Printing, and will be pursuing this. Work should
      also be pursued developing the 3D Printing Protection Profile. We
      concluded the IPP WG sessions with next steps.<br>
    </p>

    </p>
    <h2> Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup </h2>
    <p>At the start of the second day, Alan Sukert (IDS WG Chair) led
      the IDS Workgroup status and progress discussion. We went through
      the current status of the weekly HCD iTC meetings held since the
      last IDS Face-to-Face (F2F) Meeting in November 2020 and the
      efforts to develop HCD cPP v1.0 and HCD Supporting Document (SD)
      v1.0. The second internal drafts of the HCD cPP and HCD SD were
      reviewed by the full HCD iTC – 15 comments were received against
      the HCD cPP draft and 30 comments were received against the HCD SD
      draft. All comments were addressed. <br>
      <br>
      Al then led a discussion about the status of HCD iTC work to
      address a major issue concerning a proposal for managing non-field
      replaceable non-volatile storage. The proposal was that non-field
      replaceable non-volatile storage be allowed to store key material
      in clear text rather than encrypted as long as the HCD had some
      type of “purge” function that would allow the key material to be
      deleted when the HCD was ready to be decommissioned or moved to
      another location. This proposal would be in conflict with the
      requirement in the Essential Security Requirements (ESR) document
      approved by the Common Criteria Development Board (CCDB) which
      states that the HCD shall encrypt user document data and/or the
      HCD critical data (for confidentiality protection) stored on
      nonvolatile storage device if it uses nonvolatile storage device
      for the purpose of storing those data and that storage of initial
      data of the key chain on the nonvolatile storage device without
      protection would not meet the requirement. The HCD iTC is still
      determining the resolution of this issue. <br>
      <br>
      Al discussed the latest status of the HCD iTC’s Network Subgroup.
      This subgroup is looking at what to do in the HCD cPP/SD for the
      SFRs and assurance activities for the four secure protocols –
      IPsec, TLS, SSH and HTTPS, although the subgroup’s charter has
      recently been expanded to look at additional SFRs and assurance
      activities for dependencies of the four secure protocols. The
      group discussed what to do about TLS 1.3 and TLS 1.1. The HCD iTC
      had hoped to incorporate TLS 1.3 into HCD cPP/SD v1.0 but was
      waiting to see what the ND iTC did about TLS 1.3 first. It turns
      out that the ND iTC’s TLS Subgroup is currently stalled because
      NIAP recently submitted a large set of comments against the latest
      draft containing TLS 1.3 support, and many of the comments will
      require time to address. Thus, the likelihood of getting a TLS 1.3
      solution from the ND iTC in time for inclusion in HCD cPP/SD 1.0
      seems very unlikely at this point. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Ira then covered the latest HCD Security Guidelines status. An
      updated draft was not published in time to be reviewed at this
      meeting, but Smith provided updates to the Wi-Fi content in
      Section 4 and Ira changed much of the guidance in Section 4 as a
      result. Ira plans to add some material on IPP to Section 4 as
      well. Ira says he plans to have an update to the HCD Security
      Guidelines with additions to Section 5 hopefully by the end of
      March, and a full-content update sometime in Q3 2021.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, Ira gave a Liaison Report on current standards
      developments for the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), Internet
      Engineering Task Force (IETF), and Linux Foundation as part of the
      Plenary Session of the PWG Face-to-Face of which the IDS Session
      is a part of. Ira's liaison report will become part of the IDS
      Session going forward since it is mostly focused on security
      related work in other groups.<br>
