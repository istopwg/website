<p> The PWG held its <a href="https://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/august-2021-virtual.html" target="_blank">August 2021 Virtual Face-to-Face Meeting</a>
      on August 17-19, 2021 via Webex teleconferences. Representatives
      from Brother, Canon, High North, HP Inc., Kyocera Document Solutions, Lakeside Robotics, Lexmark,
      Ricoh, TIC, and TCS attended the meetings,
      among other individuals. Attendees reviewed work in progress, including
      drafts of a number of in-progress specifications, and discussed
      liaisons with partner groups. Here is a summary of the
      proceedings. </p>

<h2> PWG Plenary</h2>


    
<p> The F2F event began with the PWG Plenary session, where the PWG Chair began by reviewing the overall state of the PWG,
      its programs and initiatives, and briefly discussed upcoming
      face-to-face meeting scheduling. We noted that <a href="https://www.pwg.org/printers/" target="_blank"> there are
        currently 725 printers certified</a> under the PWG's IPP
      Everywhere™ Self Certification program with more on the way. We discussed the PWG
      Steering Committee's activities and initiatives, including
      progress on Process 4.0, new policies, and recently approved
      documents. Officers from the <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ids/" target="_blank">IDS Workgroup</a> and <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/" target="_blank">IPP Workgroup</a>
      briefly summarized their Workgroup's status, and PWG Liaison
      Officers also briefly reported on the status of our partners' work
      in Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup, Mopria Alliance, ISO
      JTC1 WG12, and INCITS. <br>

<h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup </h2>


    
<p> On the first day, Ira McDonald (IPP WG Co-Chair) and Mike Sweet
      (IPP WG Secretary) surveyed the status of current IPP Workgroup
      works in progress. The&nbsp; IPP Everywhere v1.1 Update 3
      self-certification tool set is available, and an Update 4 will be 
built and published soon, with a fix for a non-critical error in the 
"ippeveselfcert" tool. The group then briefly discussed the state of IPP
 Encrypted Jobs and Documents, which is awaiting prototyping. The IPP WG
 moved on to IPP Finishings 3.0, where we began review of a new draft 
recently posted after completing review of the previous draft about a 
week earlier. Most of the issues are editorial and it is hoped that 
prototyping can begin soon on this as well.<br>

    
    </p>

<p>After a break, we reviewed the recently posted new draft of IPP 
Production Printing Extensions, which contains some updates for roll 
feed printing and Impression / Media Sheet placement. Several new 
figures are included that also help to illustrate the "scope" influenced
 by different Job Template attributes. Also added were several new Job 
Status attributes including "date-time-at-completed-estimated", 
"date-time-at-processing-estimated", "time-at-completed-estimated" and 
"time-at-processing-estimated", which can be useful in production 
environments. IPP Production Printing Extensions is also ready for 
prototyping. The group then moved to discuss plans and scoping for 
IPP/2.x Fourth Edition and IPP Everywhere v2.0. In particular, it was 
decided to not pursue full MFD services at the initial release of IPP 
Everywhere v2.0 because of a lack of industry adoption of IPP Scan.<br>
    </p>


    
<p>On the second day, the Linux Foundation OpenPrinting group briefly 
summarized the status of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) work efforts 
recently completed, using a video motage. The students' work was 
impressive. Next, the  group completed a review of the latest draft of 
IPP Driverless Printing Extensions v2.0, which was started at the May 
2021 F2F. We discussed the new recommendation to use 
"printer-output-tray" and "output-bin" as an alternative to the 
deprecated 'jog-offset' value for "finishings" and "finishing-template".
 A number of editorial changes were also suggested. Smith agreed to 
produce a new draft in the next couple of weeks, with the objective that
 it will reach prototype phase in Q1 2022. After a lunch break, the 
group began a review of the latest draft of IPP Enterprise Printing 
Extensions v2.0, which had been published the day before. There was some
 discussion about whether it made sense to have a "Store Only" Stored 
Job that is also a Release Job. After a bit of discussion, Smith found a
 presentation from the previous year that illustrated the use case. The 
group completed the review of that new draft in one session, which seems
 to indicate its maturity. The group agreed publishing a new draft and 
prototyping the additions was the next step to moving it towared Stable 
status.</p>

<p>On the third day, following the morning's IDS session and lunch 
break, Paul Tykodi led the group in a discussion of the status of the 
PWG's 3D printing related liaison engagements. After a year of intense 
virtual participation in the various standards bodies, the group's 
efforts would be best focused in the near term on developing several 
articles on the value proposition provided by IPP in the 3D space. For 
2021-2022, the PWG should continue AMSC and ASTM F42 participation and 
continue to evangelize PWG semantics, IPP 3D, and other features of IPP.
 The group agreed that it makes sense for the PWG to sign up for another
 year of membership in American Concrete Institute (ACI), and continue 
G-code testing with IPP sample code in that enviornment. The PWG should 
also continue collaborating with PDF Association on embedded Job Ticket /
 Job Receipt work. The PWG should also ISO/IEC JTC 1 TC199 WG 12, and 
monitor or engage in work pertaining to 3D scanning, 
workflow/orchestration, and possibly other areas. We spent a little time
 talking about materials and how that contributes to the current 
process-based focus, and what challenges the industry as a whole has in 
moving to a more intent-based focus (e.g. the "what" instead of the 
"how"). The group posited that the maturity of the devices and the 
characterization of materials contributes to the maturity limitations 
that exist today. We finished up with IPP Workgroup next steps.<br>

<h2> Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup </h2>


    
<p>At the start of the third day, Alan Sukert (IDS WG Chair and 
Secretary) led the IDS Workgroup status and progress session. The group 
reviewed the results of latest Hardcopy Device international Technical 
Community (HCD iTC) meetings and the status of the HCD collaborative 
Protection Profile (cPP)/Supporting Document (SD) v1.0.</p>

<p>The HCD iTC issued the 3rd Internal Drafts of both the HCD cPP 
(2021-06-09) and the HCD SD (on 2021-06-29). There were 184 comments 
submitted against all three drafts of the HCD cPP, all of which have 
been reviewed and addressed by the HCD iTC. There have been 79 comments 
submitted against all three drafts of the HCD SD, 75 of which have been 
reviewed and addressed by the HCD iTC. <br>
</p>

<p>The HCD iTC formed a Hardware-anchored Integrity Verification 
subgroup to address a key Essential Security Requirements (ESR) document
 requirement, which states “The HCD shall verify the hardware-anchored 
integrity of firmware/software, including initial boot, operating 
system, and applications”. This subgroup completed its work in August 
2021 after 9 months of effort.</p>

<p>The group reviewed the next issues the HCD iTC has on its backlog, 
which include considering a few technical changes such as removing 
support for TLS 1.1, but also include coming to consensus on several 
process issues such as how to update the list of referenced standards 
while taking care to not inadvertently change the requirements in those 
updated referenced specifications. It is unlikely the HCD iTC will 
include any new SFRs beyond what is already in the pipeline, including a
 new SFR to include support for TLS 1.3. Ira noted that several European
 countries may not accept MFD certifications  that do not support TLS 
1.3, and suggested updating the TLS requirement to be “TLS 1.2 or 
later”. As for other SFRs, if any come in from external sources such as 
from NIAP or JBMIA or the Japanese or Korean Schemes, those would need 
to be addressed. Al presented a proposal for an update to the schedule 
presented at the May F2F, and received feedback that the schedule might 
be too aggressive because it doesn't allow for enough time for comments.</p>

<p>Al then presented an abbreviated version of a presentation he gave at
 an earlier IDS Workgroup meeting discussing the recent US Executive 
Order Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity issued by the White House on 
May 12, 2021, which was issued in response to the Solar Winds supply 
chain attack. This will have a non-trivial impact on the software 
development lifecycle and deployment pipeline.<br>
</p>

<p>Ira briefly discussed the status on the HCD Security Guidelines. The 
latest version was published May 4, 2021 Ira plans to post an Interim 
Draft in Sep 2021 with additional content in Section 4, then post 
another Interim Draft in Q4 2021 to include content in Section 5 Local 
Security (OS, Hypervisors, Peripherals, Apps) and Section 6 System 
Architecture (Firewall, AV, Process Isolation), and then post a full 
Prototype Draft in Q2 2021. Finally, Ira gave a Liaison Report on 
current standards
      developments for the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) and Internet
      Engineering Task Force (IETF).<br>
