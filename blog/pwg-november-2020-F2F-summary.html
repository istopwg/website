<h2> PWG Plenary</h2>






    
<p> The F2F event began with the PWG Plenary session. The PWG Chair reviewed the overall state of the PWG,
      its programs and initiatives, and briefly discussed upcoming
      face-to-face meeting scheduling. We noted that <a href="https://www.pwg.org/printers" target="_blank"> there are currently 625 printers certified</a>
 under the PWG's IPP Everywhere™
      Self Certification program. Lexmark registered 92 IPP Everywhere 
v1.1 printers since the PWG August Virtual F2F, becoming the second printer vendor to certify products 
and the first to certify under IPP Everywhere v1.1. HP Inc. registered 
an additional 121 IPP Everywhere v1.0 certified printers since the PWG August Virtual F2F. We discussed 
the PWG Steering Committee's 
activities and initiatives, including progress on
Process 4.0 and updated policies, public relations efforts, recently 
approved 
documents. Officers from the <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ids/" target="_blank">IDS Workgroup</a>
      and <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/" target="_blank">IPP
        Workgroup</a> summarized their Workgroup's current status, and 
PWG Liaison Officers reported on the status of our partners' work in 
Trusted Computing
      Group (TCG), IETF, Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup, Mopria
 Alliance, ISO JTC1 WG12, and INCITS.<br>
    </p>

<h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup </h2>






    
<p> On the first day, Ira McDonald (IPP WG Co-Chair) and Mike Sweet 
(IPP WG Secretary) surveyed the
      status of current IPP Workgroup works in progress and briefly 
discussed the draft charter update. IPP 
Everywhere v1.1 Update 2 self-certification tool set was recently 
approved.
PWG Last Call for Job Accounting with IPP v1.0 achieved quorum with 41 
comments, and will hopefully achieve PWG Formal Approval in Q1 2021. 
After
 a break, we discussed the IPP INFRA Cloud Proxy Registration 
initiative and made plans to produce an IPP Registration document to 
describe the relevant use cases and define additional IPP attributes to 
support them. We then briefly discussed IPP Production Printing 
Extensions, which is close to being ready for IPP WG Last Call. We 
finished the first day's meetings considering what ought to go into the 
next version of IPP Everywhere.<br>
    </p>






    
<p>On the second day, after the IDS Workgroup session and a break, the 
group reviewed the latest draft of IPP Enterprise Printing Extensions 
v2.0. We reviewed to the start of section 7. The consensus is that the 
document is mature and stable, and will soon be ready for prototyping.<br>
</p>




<p>On the third day, the  IPP 
Workgroup started with a
      review of IPP Driverless Printing Extensions v2.0. The draft 
reviewed was the first new draft since February, and included some 
additions that had been discussed in the May 2020 and August 2020 F2F 
events. The new "print-quality-col" was an area of intense discussion, 
and some more refactoring was proposed for that feature area. The new 
"client-info" attribute first proposed in this new draft as a 
replacement for "document-format-details" was also briefly discussed. 
The group committed to continuing discussion of both topics on the IPP 
WG reflector.<br>
</p>




<p>After a break, Paul Tykodi led a review of the PWG's 3D Printing 
liaisons and the 
guidance we will be providing to our partners. We started with a 
discussion of the 3D Print Protection Profile initiative,&nbsp; which 
was presented by Alan Sukert and Paul
 Tykodi at a recent INCITS TC meeting. Additional security topics were 
discussed. We then discussed recent efforts in the PDF Association 
toward supporting better interoperability between ecosystems.&nbsp; We 
also discussed the AMNOW effort, and made plans to have a call with them
 to discussed shared objectives. We concluded the 
IPP WG
 sessions with next steps.<br>
    </p>

    </p>





    
<h2> Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup </h2>





    
    
<p>At the start of the second day, Alan Sukert (IDS WG Chair) led
 the IDS Workgroup
 status and progress discussion. We went through the minutes of the 
weekly HCD iTC meetings held since the last IDS Face-to-Face (F2F) 
Meeting on August 19th. Since the IDS WG session at the PWG August 2020 
F2F, the HCD iTC reviewed and addressed all 68 received comments against
 the first internal HCD cPP draft and all 28 of the comments against the
 first internal HCD SD draft. A major issue was raised by Ricoh during 
the review of the comments against the HCD cPP draft concerning 
non-field replaceable non-volatile storage. The full HCD iTC could not 
reach any type of consensus. At Ira’s suggestion, a subgroup was formed 
to come up with a recommendation to the full iTC on what to do with the 
Ricoh proposal. The subgroup’s recommendations will be discussed at the 
next HCD iTC meeting. <br>
</p>

<p>Al briefly discussed a related issue brought up by JBMIA on 
protecting the passphrase or other mechanisms used to generate 
encryption keys. He also discussed the work of the HCD iTC’s Network Subgroup. 
This subgroup is looking at what to do in the HCD cPP/SD for the SFRs 
and assurance activities for the four secure protocols – IPsec, TLS, SSH
 and HTTPS. Al then went through the changes in the schedule caused by 
the delays in getting the first internal drafts of the HCD cPP and HCD 
SD out for review. Al finish the HCD iTC discussion with his thoughts on
 what remaining issues the HCD iTC faced in getting HCD cPP/SD v1.0 out.
 Ira then provided an overview of the changes to the latest draft of the
 HCD Security Guidelines. A detailed review would be performed in an 
upcoming IDS WG teleconference.<br>
</p>





<p>For the final topic Al went through the presentation he and Paul 
Tykodi gave to the INCITS Digital Technology Technical Committee on 
October 20th. The presentation was entitled “Common Criteria and How It 
Could Be Applied to 3D Printing”. The goal of the presentation was to 
show the TC how Common Criteria certification methodology could be 
applied to create a Protection Profile for 3D printers in a similar way 
to how the HCD PP was created for hardcopy devices and thus 2D printers. The meeting 
concluded with
next steps.<br>
