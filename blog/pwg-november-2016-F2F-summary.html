<p>The Printer Working Group November 2016 Face-to-Face meeting was held
 November 14-15, 2016. It was a "virtual face-to-face" meeting - all via
 teleconference / WebEx.&nbsp;
We discussed current and future liaisons with other groups, reviewed 
several drafts of in-progress specifications, discussed topics 
concerning printers / MFDs and Common Criteria (CC) testing and 
certification, and reviewed efforts to evolve the PWG Semantic Model. 
Below is a more detailed summary of the 
proceedings.</p>



    
<h2>PWG</h2>


<p>In the PWG Plenary, we discussed several topics relevant to the PWG 
membership community.&nbsp; First, a brief update on the state of 
membership, including a new PWG member, YSoft. Next, a summary of the 
work in progress on the creation of PWG
 Process 4, which intends to add clarifications to PWG Process 3.0, 
incorporate a number of policy 
documents' content, but also form the core of a policy framework that 
will allow policies to be updated without the approval burden of 
revising the core PWG Process. Unfortunately, little progress has been 
made since August, but the PWG Steering Committee will meet later in the
 week to continue momentum. Discussion of a proposed new whitepaper 
outlining the 
design principles and core design ethos of the PWG was next.<br>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>Following that was a status report from each of the active PWG workgroups: IPP Workgroup, 
Semantic Model Workgroup, and Imaging Device Security Workgroup. Although the IDS Workgroup
 is in 
hibernation, there continues to be discussion about some of 
the certification hurdles with the Common Criteria HCD Protection 
Profiles. The IPP Workgroup summary discussed the IPP Everywhere Self 
Certification site and process, upcoming updates to the IPP Everywhere 
Self 
Certification tools (1.0 Update 1 and 1.1).&nbsp; There are now 19 IPP 
Everywhere certified printers, and more on the way. Ira described our 
liaison relationship with Trusted Network 
Computing.&nbsp; Paul Tykodi summarized a meeting with Pete Basiliere 
from Gartner about 3D printing.<br>
</p>

<h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Working Group</h2>

<h2>


    
</h2>

<p>We reviewed the IPP/1.1 RFC updates and the latest drafts of the 
IPP System Service, IPP 3D Printing Extensions, and the IPP Finishings 
2.1 specifications.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>We noted the updates to IPP/1.1 (RFC 2910bis / 
RFC 2911bis) were nearing approval by the IETF. We 
reviewed the 
latest draft update to 5100.1 (a.k.a. "Finishings 2.1"), which has seen a
 number of changes since 
achieving Stable draft status and is now in PWG Last Call until Monday, 
December 12, 2016 . We also reviewed the latest revision of the 
IPP 3D Extensions, which is also now in PWG Last Call until Monday, 
December 12, 2016. Finally, we 
reviewed the most recently updated draft 
of the IPP System Service, which continues to make good progress toward 
reaching
 a prototype state.&nbsp;

<h2>Imaging Device Security (IDS) Working Group</h2>

<p>In the Imaging Device Security Working Group session, the attendees 
reviewed the results of the latest MFP Technical Committee Meeting held 
November 1 &amp; 3, 2016. Issues discussed included how the US and 
Japanese Common Criteria Schemes will handle interpretations and changes
 to the new Common Criteria Hardcopy Device (HCD) Protection Profile 
(PP) and Us responses to issues against this PP raised at the August PWG
 IDS Face-to-Face Meeting such as the use of Solid State Drives, use of a
 true random number generator, and concerns about producing the entropy 
and other documentation required by this PP. We also the latest status 
of turning this bilateral HCD PP between the US and Japan into an 
international collaborative PP. Finally we discussed a proposal to 
update the IDS Charter and re-position the IDS to focus on outreaching 
with other standards bodies that are involved in HCD security issues.</p>

<p>Future monthly IDS meetings are planned for the hour following the SM
 Workgroup meetings, which are on opposite alternate weeks to the IPP 
Workgroup meetings.</p>

<h2>Semantic Model (SM) Working Group

</h2>


<p>In the Semantic Model Working Group session, we discussed the need 
for the PWG membership to be engaged in the development of the PWG 
Semantic Model, and proposed bringing to the Steering Committee a 
proposal to require Semantic Model analogs to any IPP attribute or 
keyword, so that the two are kept in synchronous states of development. 
The effort to encode a PWG Print Job 
Ticket into a 3MF 3D model file was discussed briefly. Following that, 
there was a discussion 
of the effort to finalize the Semantic Model v2 (SM2).&nbsp; And 
finally, the work on Semantic Model v3 (SM3) was discussed.</p>

<p><br>
</p>





<h2>Next Meeting</h2>


    
<p>We will hold our next PWG Face-to-Face meeting February 14-15, 2017 at Apple's Sunnyvale site. Information on 
upcoming meetings is provided on the <a href="http://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/meetings.html">PWG's Meetings page</a>.<br>
