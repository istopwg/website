<p>
	The PWG held its <a href="https://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/may-2021-virtual.html" target="_blank">May 2021 Virtual Face-to-Face Meeting</a>
 on May 4-7, 2021 via Webex teleconferences. This event was held in 
collaboration with Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup. Sessions 
were presented by both organizations over the event's 4 days. 
Representatives from Artifex, Canon, Canonical, Google, High North, HP 
Inc., Konica Minolta, Kyocera Document Solutions, Lakeside Robotics, 
Lexmark, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Pharos, Red Hat, Ricoh, TIC, and TCS 
attended the meetings, among others. Attendees reviewed work in 
progress, including drafts of a number of in-progress specifications, 
and discussed liaisons with partner groups. Here is a summary of the 
proceedings. 
</p>



<h2>
	PWG Plenary 
</h2>


<p>
	The F2F event began with the PWG Plenary session, which had a reduced 
scope to limit the presentation time. The PWG Chair began with the new 
PWG Antitrust Policy, which was presented at the start of each session 
at this F2F, and will be presented at the start of all PWG 
teleconferences and F2F sessions going forward. The PWG Chair then reviewed the 
overall state of the PWG, its programs and initiatives, and briefly 
discussed upcoming face-to-face meeting scheduling. We noted that 
<a href="https://www.pwg.org/printers/" target="_blank"> there are currently 692 printers certified</a>
 under the PWG's IPP Everywhere™ Self Certification program. We 
discussed the PWG Steering Committee's activities and initiatives, 
including progress on Process 4.0, new policies, and recently approved 
documents. Officers from the <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ids/" target="_blank">IDS Workgroup</a> and <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/" target="_blank">IPP Workgroup</a>
 briefly summarized their Workgroup's status, and PWG Liaison Officers 
also briefly reported on the status of our partners' work in Mopria Alliance, 
ISO JTC1 WG12, and INCITS. <br>

<h2>
	Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup 
</h2>


<p>
	The Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup held seven sessions on the 
first and second days, covering a variety of topics. On the first day in
 the <a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/liaison/openprinting/presentations/op-plenary-may-2021-v1.pdf">OpenPrinting Plenary</a>, Ira McDonald reviewed the Linux OpenPrinting 
project's accomplishments from 2020 and surveyed the efforts under way 
for 2021.</p>

<p>Following lunch, Aveek Basu (Lexmark / Linux Foundation OpenPrinting) <a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/liaison/openprinting/presentations/OpenPrintingProjectUpdates_PWG-OPSummit-2021.pdf">presented
 a summary of the OpenPrinting Workgroup's activities</a> during Google 
Summer of Code (GSoC) and Google Season of Docs (GSoD) events in 2020, 
and also the work being done as part of the Linux Foundation Mentorship 
Program (LFMP). Piyush Goyal presented a summary of his GSoD 2021 work on 
documentation for PAPPL Applications developers [link] to the group. Aveek 
concluded with a preview of the work planned for 2021 
including attending Plumber's 2021 and engagement in the LFMP. Next, 
Michael Vrhel (Artifex) <a href="presented on the state of Ghostscript and MuPDF">presented on the state of Ghostscript and MuPDF</a>,
 covering two releases to Ghostscript and three releases of MuPDF. Other
 changes, security testing methodologies, and the status of a few other 
minor projects such as MuJS were also covered. Work planned for 2021 
includes a new PDF interpreter in Ghostscript, Ghostscript device 
interface cleanup, resolution independent display list for Ghostscript, 
digital signatures, and ".docx" file format output for Ghostscript.<br>
</p>

<p>After a break, Sean
 Kau (Google) <a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/liaison/openprinting/presentations/Printer%20Working%20Group%20-%20ChromiumOS%20Update%202021.pdf">presented on the state of Chrome OS printing</a>, reviewing 
the open source components used in the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">Chromium OS</a> / <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/">Chrome OS</a> printing 
system, including CUPS, cups-filters, Avahi, Ghostscript, and 
sane-airscan. Recent additions include expanded lpadmin errors and 
greater use of automated testing. New projects originated by the Google 
Chromium printing team include foomatic_shell, virtual-usb-printer, and 
ippusb_bridge, which is implemented in Rust. The presentation concluded 
with some discussion about scanning and the standards available today 
(eSCL and IPP Scan) and the desire for some additional features 
including "push scan".<br>
</p>



<p>On the second day, Mike Sweet (Lakeside Robotics) <a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/liaison/openprinting/presentations/cups-plenary-may-2021.pdf">presented the CUPS 
Plenary</a>, covering the changes that have occurred between <a href="https://www.cups.org">Apple's "main" 
CUPS distribution</a> and the <a href="https://openprinting.github.io/projects/00-cups/">OpenPrinting CUPS fork</a>, which is seeing more 
active development. Mike is now coordinating code changes across the two
 distributions, with OpenPrinting CUPS pushing toward a 2.4.0 release. 
Apple will likely release a 2.3.5 release sometime in June 2021. CUPS 
2.4 is expected to include many changes including shared printers 
reporting all required attributes/keys/values, OAuth 2.0/OpenID 
authentication, pkg-config support, snapcraft support, "job-sheets-col" 
and better "media-col" attribute support, TLS and X.509 improvements, 
and some new deprecations (cups-config and Kerberos authentication). 
Mike then reviewed the current plans for CUPS 3.0, which will be a 
profound change in architecture to previous CUPS releases. Much work is 
needed for this transformation to occur. Mike then <a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/liaison/openprinting/presentations/printer-applications-may-2021.pdf">presented on the 
state of CUPS Printer Applications</a>, which are the successor to the 
legacy CUPS PPD / driver architecture. Mike has been working on the 
<a href="https://www.msweet.org/pappl/">PAPPL framework</a> for creating Printer Applications, and Till Kamppeter 
has been using this to create the new PostScript Printer Application. 
Till then <a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/liaison/openprinting/presentations/ps-printer-app-2021.pdf">presented a discussion of the details of the PostScript 
Printer Application</a>, noting that it supports 4000 models based on PPDs from 
Foomatic and HPLIP. The project is nearly feature complete.</p>

<p>After lunch, Till <a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/liaison/openprinting/presentations/cups-filters-cups-snap-ipp-usb-and-more-2021.pdf">presented an overview of the status of cups-filters, 
CUPS SNAP, IPP USB, and other projects</a>. The <a href="https://openprinting.github.io/projects/01-cups-filters/">cups-filters project</a> is 
evolving with CUPS in many ways, including encapsulating filter binary 
functions within discrete library functions, reducing the overhead of 
spawning independent processes. The libppd and driverless utility 
projects were discussed. A major effort is underway to release CUPS as a
 Snap. Driverless scanning is also a major area of engagement by the 
OpenPrinting Workgroup currently, and the complexities of that effort 
were covered in detail. Implementation issues with IPP USB were also 
discussed. Till concluded with a discussion about GUI requirements.<br>

<h2>
	Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup 
</h2>


<p>
	IPP Workgroup sessions started on the second day of the F2F event with a
 status summary of IPP Workgroup activities currently in progress. IPP 
Everywhere v1.1 will become mandatory starting July 1, 2021. The IPP 
Everywhere Self Certification tools currently available are v1.0 update 5
 and v1.1 update 2, with v1.1 update 3 hopefully available the week 
after the F2F event.<br>
</p>


<p>
	The IPP WG continued to discuss the evolution of IPP/2.0 and reviewed 
the initial draft of Internet Printing Protocol/2.x Fourth Edition 
(BASE). The discussion centered around the document's scope and how that
 relates to versioning and existing standards such as 5100.12 and STD 
92. We then shifted to discuss scoping IPP Everywhere v2.0. We agreed 
"photo printing" is an important vertical solution that should be tested
 as a defined feature. We also discussed whether System Service should 
be included or not, and at what point we dedicate more energy to this, 
noting that we should first conclude our work on NODRIVER, EPX, and PPX.<br>
</p>


<p>
	On the third day, following the IDS session, we reviewed the new draft 
of IPP Encrypted Jobs and Documents v1.0 (TRUSTNOONE), which has been 
updated to incorporate S/MIME 4.0 (RFC 8551) and make that the primary 
required technology. OpenPGP will be left in but its description will be
 moved to an informative annex, making it an unofficial optional 
technology for TRUSTNOONE. Mike will announce it for more broad review 
once the new draft has been created. 
</p>


<p>
	We then had a Cloud Printing and Scanning BoF to generally discuss open
 next directions for INFRA and other PWG specifications to support these
 use cases for both 2D and 3D printing. We agreed that we needed to more
 clearly define the set of use cases for some of these general domains. 
Smith pointed out the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant and we agreed
 we should incorporate that into the range of options for registering a 
new IPP Proxy with a Cloud Print solution. We discussed some of the 
challenges with printing directly to a printer that is advertised via a 
cloud, and deferred discussion of IPP Scan enhancements until there are 
more examples of it being implemented in the field. We finished off the 
day by starting a review of the latest IPP Enterprise Printing 
Extensions v2.0. A number of changes were suggested.<br>
</p>


<p>
	On the last day, we began with a 3D Scanning and Production BoF, where 
we discussed file formats and their applicability to different important
 3D scanning use cases, including acquiring point cloud data about an 
existing object and scanning a produced part for quality control. The 
E57 format is common for laser / LIDAR scanners but not used much for 
scanning smaller objects or for scanners that use cameras. The group 
speculatively agreed 3MF would be a good file format for 3D scanning 
that should satisfy both use cases.<br>
</p>


<p>
	After a break, we began a review of the latest draft of IPP Driverless 
Printing Extensions v2.0 (NODRIVER), which contains a resolution for the
 "print-quality" enhancements. Smith decided that Mike's proposal to 
encode this as an extension to "job-presets-supported" had some 
advantages over his own proposal. The group had a long discussion about 
the "print-processing-attributes-supported" attribute, which was 
basically the same as the earlier proposed 
"print-quality-hints-supported" attribute with a simplified definition 
and a new name. The discussion was productive and allowed the group to 
realize the value of some of the content present in earlier drafts that 
was removed. We then briefly reviewed the new draft of IPP Production 
Printing Extensions (PPX) which added the "job- phone-number", 
"job-phone-number-default", "job-phone-number-supported", "job- 
recipient-name", "job-recipient-name-default", and 
"job-recipient-name-supported" attributes that were removed from EPX. We
 concluded with Next Steps.<br>

<h2>
	Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup 
</h2>


<p>
	The Imaging Device Security session was held at the start of the third 
day. Al started by presenting the current status of the HCD iTC and its 
efforts to develop HCD cPP v1.0 and HCD SD v1.0. Additional comments had
 been submitted against the 2nd internal drafts of the HCD cPP and HCD 
SD to implement the recommendations of the Network Subgroup. The HCD iTC
 has spent the past few weeks completing the Security Problem Definition
 (SPD) and gathering feedback. A new Essential Security Requirements 
(ESR) document requirement, “The HCD shall verify the hardware-anchored 
integrity of firmware/software, including initial boot, operating 
system, and applications”, was added at the request of the HCD iTC. The 
HCD iTC formed a Hardware-anchored Integrity Verification subgroup to 
address this requirement. That subgroup developed a Secure Boot SFR
 (FPT_SBT_EXT) that addresses this ESR requirement and the subgroup will recommend 
to the full HCD iTC that it be added to the HCD cPP. The HCD iTC is now 
evaluating several SFRs including the NTP SFR, updates to the 
FPT_KYP_EXT Protection of Key and Key Material SFR from JBMIA, and 
feedback from the ITSCC on the ESR requirement “The HCD shall generate 
audit data, and be capable of sending it to a trusted external IT entity
 and store it in the HCD”. Al also discussed the deferred areas that the
 HCD iTC needs to engage on, and presented a proposal for a revised 
schedule, which puts completion in March 2022. He concluded the 
discussion about the HCD iTC with some thoughts on lessons learned over 
the last 14 months. 
</p>


<p>
	Al then reviewed the results of a discussion in a previous IDS 
Workgroup meeting with two members of the Massachusetts Department of 
Transportation (MASS DOT). One highlight of the discussion was that the 
MASS DOT members noticed that even when public interfaces are specified 
and in place for a long time, even if they are not correctly specified, 
they are very difficult to get changed because printer owners are 
concerned about unknown consequences to customers if configurations are 
changed. This is something that was new to many of us at the IDS meeting
 but is pretty well known to the IPP Workgroup. 
</p>


<p>
	Ira then covered the latest HCD Security Guidelines status. An updated 
draft was not published in time to be reviewed at this meeting, but 
Smith provided updates to the Wi-Fi content in Section 4 and Ira changed
 much of the guidance in Section 4 as a result. Ira plans to add some 
material on IPP to Section 4 as well. Ira says he plans to have a 
full-content update sometime in Q3 2021. The meeting concluded with Ira 
summarizing current standards development efforts in the Trusted 
Computing Group (TCG) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) 
that pertain to the IDS domain.<br>
