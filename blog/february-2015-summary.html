    <p>The Printer Working Group recently held a face-to-face meeting on February 3-5, 2015 in El Segundo, CA. We discussed current and future liaison's with other standards groups and reviewed several drafts of in-progress specifications. What follows is a summary of the proceedings.</p>
    <h2>Cloud Imaging Model Workgroup</h2>
    <p>During the Cloud Imaging Model workgroup session, we reviewed the history of the project and looked at key section of the Cloud Imaging Requirements and Model which is currently in PWG Last Call. Some issues for integrating the new model with version 3 of the Semantic Model were identified for future discussion.</p>
    <p>The next Cloud Imaging Model conference call is on February 23, 2014 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/cloud">cloud</a> mailing list for details.</p>
    <h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup</h2>
    <p>We reviewed many in-progress documents during two sessions. The review of an updated stable draft of the IPP workgroup charter identified some editorial changes that are needed before the charter is sent to the PWG Steering Committee for approval.</p>
    <p>The review of the prototype experience for the IPP Everywhere Printer Self-Certification Manual (SELFCERT) identified one additional prototyping requirement (test) needed before that document can advance to Stable status. Mike will coordinate this testing with an IPP Everywhere implementor before the next face-to-face meeting.</p>
    <p>One editorial issue was identified and will be included in last call comments for the IPP Shared Infrastructure Extensions (INFRA) specification that is in PWG Last Call. We expect to move this document to PWG Formal Vote in the coming months.</p>
    <p>During the review of the IPP System Service specification, we discussed service creation and deletion, security policies, subscriptions and notifications, and the format for the operation descriptions, most of which are described fully in various Cloud and Semantic Model specifications.</p>
    <p>We finished a full review of the IPP Implementor's Guide 2.0 (IG) with suggestions for minor organizational and editorial changes. Smith is using an open source tool to generate excellent UML diagrams (<a href="http://plantuml.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">PlantUML</a>) for this document. We plan to advance this document to Workgroup Last Call soon.</p>
    <p>Two proposals from HP were also discussed pertaining to the "job-password" operation attribute and support for encrypted documents. For the "job-password" attribute we talked about ways for a Printer to advertise the required/supported content such as numeric PINs or complex passwords, with one method using a pattern string and another using pre-defined policy keywords. Discussions concerning encrypted document support included the work being done in the IDS workgroup, ways to encapsulate document data, providing digital signatures to detect alteration, and key management. We will continue to explore these proposals as separate white papers.</p>
    <p>The next Internet Printing Protocol conference call is on November 17, 2014 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/ipp">ipp</a> mailing list for details.</p>
    <h2>Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup</h2>
    <p>We reviewed the status of the new 200 page MFP Protection Protocol (PP) which has many comments to be reviewed. A new review draft is expected the week of February 16, 2015. We then reviewed the latest IDS Model and IAA specifications and identified several editorial and technical changes.</p>
    <p>The next Imaging Device Security conference call is on February 16, 2015 at 2pm ET / 11am PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/ids">ids</a> mailing list for details.</p>
    <h2>Semantic Model (SM) Workgroup</h2>
    <p>We reviewed the latest draft of the JDF Mapping document. The document will continue to be developed during special conference calls.</p>
    <p>The next Semantic Model conference call is on February 23, 2015 at 2pm ET / 11am PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/sm3">sm3</a> mailing list for details.</p>
    <h2>Next Meeting</h2>
    <p>We will hold our next meeting on April 28 to May 1, 2015 in Cupertino, CA hosted at Apple's facilities.</p>
