    <p> The PWG held its <a href="https://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/november-2019-virtual.html" target="_blank">November 2019 Virtual Face-to-Face Meeting</a>
      on November 20-21, 2019 via WebEx teleconferences. Representatives
      from Apple, Canon, Google, High North, HP Inc., Kyocera,
      Lexmark, TIC, TCS and Xerox attended the meetings.
      Attendees reviewed work in progress, including drafts of a number
      of in-progress specifications, and discussed liaisons with partner
      groups. Here is a summary of the proceedings. </p>
    <h2> PWG Plenary</h2>
    <p> As in previous PWG Face to Face events, the PWG Chair presented the Plenary.
      We reviewed the overall state of the PWG,
      its programs and initiatives, and briefly discussed upcoming
      face-to-face meeting scheduling. We noted that <a href="https://www.pwg.org/printers" target="_blank"> there are
        now 412 printers certified</a> under the PWG's IPP Everywhere™
      Self Certification program, with more certifications believed to
      be in progress. We discussed the PWG Steering Committee's 
activities and initiatives, including PR efforts, recently approved 
documents, process document updates, the website migration initiative, 
and "toolset" alternatives for producing specifications. Each active PWG
 workgroup (<a href="https://www.pwg.org/ids/" target="_blank">IDS Workgroup</a>
      and <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/" target="_blank">IPP
        Workgroup</a>) summarized their current status. Finally, we
      reviewed the status of our partners' work in Trusted Computing
      Group (TCG), IETF, Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup, Mopria Alliance and 3MF Consortium.<br>

    </p>
    <h2> Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup </h2>
    <p> On the first day, Ira McDonald (IPP WG Co-Chair) and Mike Sweet 
(IPP WG Secretary) surveyed the
      status of current IPP Workgroup works in progress. We then briefly
 reviewed the status of IPP
      Everywhere™ v1.1 and IPP Everywhere Self Certification v1.1, 
noting that a 1.0 Update 4 certification test suite would be made 
available soon. We then discussed a PWG presentation authored by Mike 
Sweet for the UK GovPrint Initiative, pointing out the availability of 
open technologies from the PWG as possible solutions. After
 a break, we briefly discussed the status of IPP System Service, which 
was in PWG Formal Approval completing on November 22, 2019 and was 
approved as PWG 5100.22, to be published soon. We then completed a full 
review of the latest 
draft of IPP Enterprise Printing Extensions v2.0, which ran over. We 
finished the day with IPP Production Printing Extensions v2.0, noting 
some minor normative language changes and an addition for roll feed 
printers. We deferred review of IPP Driverless Printing Extensions until
 the following day.<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the second day, after the IDS Workgroup session, the IPP 
Workgroup sessions started with a
      review of IPP Driverless Printing Extensions v2.0, during what was originally scheduled to be
 the IPP Encrypted Jobs and Documents v1.0 session. (Since that document
 hadn't been updated since its last review, further discussion of that 
document was postponed). The document wasn't fully reviewed but good 
progress was made, and the review would be completed at the next IPP WG 
teleconference. We then shifted to Job Accounting with IPP v1.0, and had
 some very productive discussions about security and use models. After a
 break, 
Paul Tykodi led a discussion on the status of the PWG's 3D Printing 
related liaisons and outreach efforts, noting that we were in the 
process of establishing a liaison with INCITS. We concluded the IPP WG's
 sessions with next steps.<br>

    </p>
    <h2> Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup </h2>
    
    <p>At the start of the second day, Alan Sukert led the IDS Workgroup
 status and progress discussion. It was mentioned that FIPS 140-3 will 
become required on all cryptographic modules in the US on or after 
September 22, 2021, and we discussed how that will affect Common 
Criteria certification after that date. We also discussed what will 
happen after the IEEE sunsets the two 2600 Protection Profiles (PPs) on 
Dec 31, 2019. In particular, there was concern about whether the 
specifications themselves would continue to be available. That would 
seem to put pressure on the HCD TC to get the HCD cPP v1.0 done as 
quickly as possible once it becomes an HCD international TC (iTC). 
Status of that initiative was then discussed. The IDS WG members are 
hoping to drive an aggressive schedule in the iTC once it is formed. The
 rollout timeline and additional needs were discussed. Ira and Alan 
briefly discussed the status of the PWG HCD Security Guide draft and 
some proposed additions. We wrapped up with next steps.<br>
