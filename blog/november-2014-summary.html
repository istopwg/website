    <p>The Printer Working Group recently held a face-to-face meeting on November 4-5, 2014 in Waltham, MA. We discussed current and future liaison's with other standards groups and reviewed several drafts of in-progress specifications. What follows is a summary of the proceedings.</p>
    <h2>Cloud Imaging Model and IPP Shared Infrastructure Extensions</h2>
    <p>During the joint Cloud Imaging Model and IPP workgroup session, we reviewed the Apple prototyping experience which highlighted three key issues: registration, deregistration, and static resources. Proposals to address these issues were presented and discussed, with changes to the Cloud Imaging Requirements and Model, IPP Shared Infrastructure Extensions, and IPP System Service specifications to follow.</p>
    <p>The next Cloud Imaging Model conference call is on December 1, 2014 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/cloud">cloud</a> mailing list for details.</p>
    <h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup</h2>
    <p>We reviewed an updated stable draft of the IPP Scan Service specification that addressed all of the formal vote comments. Some additional editorial issues were identified for correction prior to publication. We also reviewed all of the last call comments for the IPP Finishings 2.0 (FIN) specification and resolved all pending comments so that the specification can move to PWG Formal Vote.</p>
    <p>During the review of the IPP System Service specification, we decided to merge the Semantic Model Resource service into the System Service, to define the implication resource creation for PUT requests, and to clarify the access control requirements for operations that should be allowed for ordinary users.</p>
    <p>The next Internet Printing Protocol conference call is on November 17, 2014 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/ipp">ipp</a> mailing list for details.</p>
    <h2>Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup</h2>
    <p>We reviewed the outstanding comments for the new MFP Protection Protocol (PP), specifically the full-disk encryption requirements. We then reviewed the latest IDS Model and IAA specifications and identified several editorial and technical changes.</p>
    <p>The next Imaging Device Security conference call is on November 17, 2014 at 2pm ET / 11am PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/ids">ids</a> mailing list for details.</p>
    <h2>Semantic Model (SM) Workgroup</h2>
    <p>We reviewed the latest draft of the JDF Mapping document. The document will continue to be developed during special conference calls.</p>
    <p>We also updated the outline of the Semantic Model 3.0 documents, which will now be split into two parts: Imaging System and Jobs &amp; Documents. The new Semantic Model will also feature a combined System and Resource service.</p>
    <p>The next Semantic Model conference call is on December 1, 2014 at 2pm ET / 11am PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/sm3">sm3</a> mailing list for details.</p>
