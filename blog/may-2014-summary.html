             <p>The Printer Working Group recently held a face-to-face meeting on May 13-15, 2014 at Apple's facilities in Cupertino, CA. We discussed current and future liaison's with other standards groups, reviewed several drafts of in-progress specifications, and developed the outline of the three new Semantic Model 3.0 specifications. What follows is a summary of the proceedings.</p>
             <h2>Plenary</h2>
             <p>During the plenary we reviewed the current workgroup and liaison status and announced the PWG White Paper policy for new work. A new web page on <a href="../chair/participating.html">participating</a> has been created with links to the policy and white paper templates.</p>
             <h2>Cloud Imaging Workgroup</h2>
             <p>We reviewed the first half of the Cloud Imaging Requirements and Model specification. The review identified some editorial issues and cleaned up some operation definitions to be consistent with IPPSIX. We also decided to formally define "Local Imaging Service" and "Local Imaging System" to refer to the services and system that are being proxied.</p>
             <p>The next Cloud Imaging conference call is on June 9, 2014 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/cloud">cloud</a> mailing list for details.</p>
             <h2>Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup</h2>
             <p>We did a status update of the MFP Protection Profile (PP) and decided to do a joint session with the MFP PP Technical Committee at the August 2014 F2F meeting. We also reviewed the latest TNC Binding and IDS Model drafts, identifying several editorial issues and updating the defined actors and roles.</p>
             <p>The TNC Binding specification is awaiting prototype experience before it can advance to stable status. The IDS Model specification will continue to be developed in the coming months.</p>
             <p>The next Imaging Device Security conference call is on June 2, 2014 at 2pm ET / 11am PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/ids">ids</a> mailing list for details.</p>
             <h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup</h2>
             <p>We reviewed proposals for new media size names and extensions to the printer-output-tray attribute syntax, and reviewed the current drafts of the IPP Everywhere Printer Self-Certification Manual 1.0, IPP Finishings 2.0, IPP Implementors Guide v2.0, and IPP Scan Service.</p>
             <p>During the review of the IPP Everywhere Printer Self-Certification Manual 1.0 we identified several editorial issues, finalized the processes for submission, approval, and exceptions, and identified the tests for which we will grant exceptions. Beta software and tools will be available prior to the August F2F.</p>
             <p>During our review of the IPP Implementors Guide v2.0, we discussed potential Client fingerprinting solutions in order to satisfy expectations, deciding that doing so was a bad idea and that we should work to address any inconsistencies in Printer behavior so that Clients can specify their expectations fully. This document is ready to move to prototype status.</p>
             <p>During our review of the IPP Finishings 2.0, we determined that a new figure is needed to show the finishing coordinate system and the location of staples, holes, etc. Examples for stapling will also be shown for the "finishings-col" attribute, much as is already provided for folding. Once prototype experience has been reported, this document will move to stable status and enter Workgroup Last Call.</p>
             <p>During our review of the IPP Scan Service, we identified a few additional editorial issues, which will be resolved at the conclusion of the Workgroup Last Call for this document. Additional discussion on the requirement for dateTime attributes continued on the IPP mailing list. We plan to move this document to PWG Last Call in mid-June 2014.</p>
             <p>The next Internet Printing Protocol conference call is on June 2, 2014 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/ipp">ipp</a> mailing list for details.</p>
             <h2>Semantic Model (SM) Workgroup</h2>
             <p>We reviewed the latest JDFMAP document and identified several elements that either were incorrectly mapped or should not be mapped. Work on JDFMAP will continue in conference calls and at the August 2014 face-to-face meeting.</p>
             <p>We also determined that three new specifications will be required for the Semantic Model 3.0 project: Imaging System, Subunits, and Jobs &amp; Documents. An outline for each document was produced, with a copy posted to the SM3 mailing list.</p>
             <p>The next Semantic Model conference call is on June 9, 2014 at 2pm ET / 11am PT. Please see the <a href="../mailman/listinfo/sm3">sm3</a> mailing list for details.</p>
             <h2>Next Meeting</h2>
             <p>We will hold our next meeting on August 12-15, 2014 at the Hilton Garden Inn in Toronto, Ontario (Canada). This meeting will also host the OpenPrinting group.</p>
