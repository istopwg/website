    <p> The PWG held its <a href="https://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/april-2019-lexington.html" target="_blank">April 2019 Face-to-Face Meeting</a>
      on April 16-18, 2019 at Lexmark's headquarters in Lexington, Kentucky. This event was held in collaboration with Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup</a>. Sessions were presented by both organizations over the event's 3 days. Representatives from Apple, Artifex, Canon, Google, High North, HP Inc., Lexmark, Kyocera, Mopria, Qualcomm, Red Hat, Ricoh, TIC, TCS and Xerox attended 
the meetings. Attendees
      reviewed work in progress including drafts of a number of
      in-progress specifications and papers, discussed proposals for new
 work, and discussed liaisons with partner
      groups. Here is a summary of the proceedings. </p>
    <h2> PWG Plenary </h2>
    <p> In the PWG Plenary, we reviewed the overall state of the PWG,
      its programs and initiatives, and briefly discussed upcoming
      face-to-face meeting scheduling. We noted that <a href="https://www.pwg.org/printers" target="_blank"> there are
        now 365 printers certified </a> by the PWG's IPP Everywhereâ„¢
      Self Certification program, with more certifications believed to
      be in progress. Leaders of the two active PWG workgroups (<a href="https://www.pwg.org/ids/" target="_blank">IDS Work Group</a>
      and <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/" target="_blank">IPP
        Work Group</a>) summarized their current status. Finally, we
      reviewed the status of our partners' work in Trusted Computing
      Group (TCG), IETF, Mopria Alliance, Linux Foundation OpenPrinting
      Workgroup, and a quick summary of our 3D liaisons.<br>

<h2>Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup</h2>
<p>In the Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup sessions on the first 
day, Ira McDonald reviewed the Linux OpenPrinting project's 
accomplishments from 2018 and surveyed the efforts under way for 2019. 
Work included completing the work to move the filters to QPDF or MuPDF 
from Poppler, and a focus on reliability and bug fixes. Preparations 
continue for the shift from CUPS 2.2.x to 2.3, and full support for the 
soon-to-be-ratified IPP System Service. Ira also announced the adoption 
of a new logo and website for Linux OpenPrinting. <br>
</p>
<p>Mike Sweet presented the CUPS Plenary, reviewing the status of CUPS 
2.2.x and the development status of CUPS 2.3, including a more detailed 
discussion of the CUPS 2.3 changes and enhancements. He also spent some 
time reviewing the significant deprecated feature sets from legacy CUPS 
releases to help developers understand why they are deprecated and the 
importance of moving to the new APIs. He finished with a discussion of 
CUPS Future features. <br>
</p>
<p>After lunch, Aveek Basu presented a review of the Linux OpenPrinting 
Workgroup's projects that are active in 2019. He discussed the upcoming 
"Google Summer of Code 2019" projects that will implement a generic 
framework for converting legacy drivers into CUPS Printer Applications, 
and test suites for IPP System Service, IPP Job Extensions 1.1, IPP 
Document Object 1.1, and IPP 3D Printing Extensions 1.1. He also covered
 the Linux OpenPrinting Workgroup's engagement in "Google Season of 
Docs", "Google Code In", and "Linux Plumbers Conference".</p>
<p>Sean Kau presented "Printing in Chrome OS", covering system details 
that differ from other operating system environments and how that 
affects printing support. He discussed some of the security features of 
Chrome OS and the work done to build releases for the various hardware 
platforms that run Chrome OS. Many of the software components developed 
by the Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup, as well as an unmodified
 CUPS release, are deployed as the core components of the Chrome OS 
print system. IPP Everywhere is supported out-of-box and helps to enable
 universal printing.</p>
<p>After a break, Till Kamppeter presented a detailed survey of 
completed, in-process and future work in the "cups-filters" and 
"ippusbxd" projects. Many bug fixes were made in 2018, and work 
continues on both of these projects.  To close out the day, Michael 
Vrhel took us through a review of the status of Ghostscript, MuPDF and 
associated projects such as MuJS and MuPDF WebAssembly. Color space 
handling for unconventional color spaces was discussed, as well as code 
security and analysis.</p>
<p>Minutes were not taken, but all slides presented are available on the <a href="https://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/april-2019-lexington.html">April 2019 F2F Event Page</a>.<br>

<h2>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup </h2>

    <p>The second day of the F2F event was dominated by IPP Workgroup 
sessions covering the majority of the Workgroup's wide range of 
engagement topics. Ira McDonald and Mike Sweet kicked it off by 
summarizing the
      status of current IPP Workgroup activities. We then moved to 3D 
Printing, considering the value and work required for the PWG to develop
 a an IPP 3D GUI client prototype. Paul Tykodi guided us through a 
discussion of work ISO JTC1 WG12, SME, AMSE, and related standards work 
outside the PWG to which Paul has been liaising and evangelizing PWG  
IPP 3D related semantics and technologies. There is growing interest in 
the work we did earlier with IPP 3D Printing Extensions. Characterizing 
materials and new 3D printing technologies may be needed in the future, 
but the consensus is that we are prepared for that work with the 
foundation we have laid with IPP 3D Printing Extensions v1.1, PWG Safe 
G-Code, and IPP Everywhere.</p>
<p>After a break, Mike and Ira covered the status of IPP System Service.
 Mike is close to completing prototyping work using ippserver, and 
showed a demo. Sean noted that the non-standard IPP attributes specific 
to the ippserver's implementation are non-standard, by renaming them to 
use the "smi2699-" prefix. We talked about the "Printer template" 
resource that could be used in a Create-Printer operation, which could 
make it very easy to create a new printer. We think Q2 is still a good 
target for getting to a stable draft, with specification finalization 
targeting late Q3 / early Q4 2019.</p>
<p>During lunch, Rick Yardumian presented a slide deck contributed by 
Canon. The slide set described a collection of various features Canon 
would like supported in IPP if they are not supported already. The group
 discussed each feature, some of which seemed to be supportable with IPP
 today, while others might need some additional specification work.</p>
<p>After lunch, we discussed the state of IPP Everywhere v1.1, and Mike 
demonstrated a new tool to convert the self certification report to a 
JSON format, that is intended to be used with the revised submission 
process. We discussed the requirements for print servers compared to 
physical printers, and also discussed relaxing the DNS-SD requirements 
for enterprise-class MFDs.</p>
<p>After a break, we reviewed the latest draft of IPP Enterprise 
Printing Extensions v1.0. We considered the semantics of feature 
terminology introduced by that draft and how it overlapped with JPS2 
(PWG 5100.11). Job state phases and states were discussed, which are 
very important to the semantics of the new Proof Job and Stored Job 
feature concepts. We cut the review of this short to move on  to IPP Job
 Extensions v2.0. <br>
</p>
<p>In the Job Extensions v2.0 review, we engaged on the fate of the 
much-discussed "document-format-details". A vigorous and productive 
discussion reviewing the merits and demerits of that attribute and its 
members, as well as the value that some of its members provided, 
produced a consensus for deprecating the attribute and some of its 
members while obsoleting other members. This led into the Job Accounting
 BoF, where we had a more open-ended discussion of use cases and 
requirements for job accounting generally. This will help to inform the 
IPP Workgroup in creating a sound functional replacement for 
"document-format-details" and other attributes used for Job Accounting. 
We plan to have another Job Accounting BoF at the August F2F.</p>
<p>On the third day, Mike led a review of the latest draft of IPP Encrypted Jobs and Documents. 
We considered use cases for the ownership of encryption keys, which 
might come from the Printer, but might also come from the User / Client.
 The group consensus was that this document should become a Standards 
Track specification, not a registration, because of its scope and 
uniqueness. Notifications for future drafts will be posted to both the 
IPP Workgroup and the IDS Workgroup, to encourage the IDS members to 
provide feedback from their own security-focused perspectives. We 
concluded our IPP sessions with next steps for the IPP Workgroup.<br>

    </p>
    <h2> Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup </h2>
    <p> On the third day, Alan Sukert led the IDS
      Workgroup session with a review of state of the final draft of the
 Hardcopy Device (HCD) Protection Profile (PP) v1.1 proposed
      at the Hardcopy Device Technical Community (HCD-TC) face-to-face 
meeting held in Rome two weeks earlier. The NIAP TLS Package v1.1 was 
discussed for its candidacy as a possible addition to the HCD PP. Also, 
the latest HCD iTC Terms of Reference (ToR) and Essential Security 
Requirements (ESR) drafts were reviewed, which are the documents 
required by the process to
      create an HCD international Technical Committee (iTC). We 
then discussed thoughts on issues the HCD TC needed to address to 
transition from an HCD TC to an HCD iTC, and some thoughts on what 
requirements should be included in the eventual HCD collaborative PP 
(cPP). Finally, Ira provided an overview of the PWG Hardcopy Device Security Guidelines he is developing.
