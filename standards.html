	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.1-2001 - IPP "finishings" attribute values extension</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippfinishings10-20010205-5100.1.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This document specifies the additional enum values 'fold', 'trim', 'bale', 'booklet-maker', 'jog-offset', 'bind-left', 'bind-top', 'bind-right', and 'bind-bottom' for the IPP "finishings" Job Template attribute for use with the Internet Printing Protocol/1.0 (IPP) [RFC2566, RFC2565] and Internet Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP) [RFC2911, RFC2910]. This attribute permits the client to specify additional finishing options, including values that include a specification of a coordinate system for the placement of finishings operation with respect to the corners and edges of portrait and landscape documents.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.2-2001 - IPP "output-bin" attribute extension</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippoutputbin10-20010207-5100.2.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This document defines an extension to the Internet Printing Protocol/1.0 (IPP/1.0) [RFC2566, RFC2565] &amp; IPP/1.1 [RFC2911, RFC2910] for the OPTIONAL "output-bin" (type2 keyword | name(MAX)) Job Template attribute. This attribute allows the client to specify in which output bin a job is to be placed and to query the Printer's default and supported output bins.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.3-2001 - Production Printing Attributes - Set 1</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippprodprint10-20010212-5100.3.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This document specifies an extension to the Internet Printing Protocol/1.0 (IPP) [RFC2565, RFC2566] and IPP/1.1 [RFC2910, RFC2911]. This extension consists primarily of Job Template attributes defined for submitting print jobs primarily (but not limited to) to production printers. These attributes permit a user to control and/or override instructions in the document content to perform the following functions: print on document covers, control the positioning of stapling, force pages to the front side of the media, identify an imposition template, insert sheets into the document, provide an accounting id, provide an accounting user id, request accounting sheets, provide job sheet messages, request error sheets, provide a message to the operator, control the media used for job sheets, request media by characteristic (size, weight, etc.), request to check the media characteristics in an input tray, specify the presentation direction of page images with number-up, and shift the images of finished pages.</p>
	    <p>This extension also defines the "current-page-order" Job Description attribute, the "user-defined-values-supported" and "max-stitching-locations-supported" Printer Description attributes, and the 'resources-are-not-supported' value for the "job-state-reasons" Job Description attribute. Some additional "media" keyword values are defined for use with the "media" and "media-col" Job Template attributes.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.5-2003 - IPP Document Object</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippdocobject10-20031031-5100.5.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This IPP specification extends the IPP Protocol, Model and Semantics [rfc2910], [rfc2911] object model by defining a Document object. The [rfc2911] Job object is extended to contain one or more Document objects that are passive objects operated on by the Job. Multi-Document Jobs exist in IPP [rfc2911] but are not objects in their own right. This specification elevates the Document to an IPP object thus giving access to a document's metadata within a Job. A Document object allows template attributes to be applied at both the Job and Document level. This enables document overrides of Job Template attributes.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.6-2003 - IPP Page Overrides</h3>
	    <p><em>(Obsoletes 5100.4-2001 - IPP Overrides Attributes for Document and Pages)</em></p>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ipppageoverride10-20031031-5100.6.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This IPP specification extends the IPP Model and Semantics [rfc2911] object model by relaxing the restriction that each attribute value is the same for all pages within a Document. For example, with this extension, page 1 of a job could have a different media than the other pages in the job.</p>
	    <p>This extension supports page Overrides by adding a new Job Template attribute: "overrides". Each 'collection' value contains attributes that identify the attributes to Override and their associated values as well as the range of pages for the Override. The range of pages is specified by the "document-copies" attribute and the "pages" attribute to allow Overrides of pages in specific copies of the document.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.7-2003 - IPP Job Extensions</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippjobext10-20031031-5100.7.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This IPP specification extends the Job semantics of the IPP Model and Semantics [rfc2911] object model. This specification defines some new Operation attributes for use in Job Creation and Document Creation operations. The Printer copies these Operation attributes to the corresponding Job Description attributes, which the clients may query. The Document Creation Operation attributes describe the Document Content and permit the Printer to reject requests that it cannot process correctly. Some corresponding "xxx-default" and "xxx-supported" Printer attributes are defined. This specification defines some Job Template attributes that apply to a multi-document Job as a whole and the "output-device" Job Template attribute that can apply to Documents and to Sheets as well as Jobs. This specification also defines some additional values for the "job-state-reasons" Job Description attribute. Each of the attributes defined in this specification are independent of each other and are OPTIONAL for a Printer to support.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.8-2003 - IPP "-actuals" Attributes</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippactuals10-20030313-5100.8.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This document defines an extension to the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) (RFC2911, RFC2910) for the OPTIONAL "-actual" set of Job Description attributes that correspond to Job Template attributes defined in IPP. These "-actual" attributes allow the client to determine the true results of a print job regardless of what was specified in the Create-Job or Print-Job operation.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.9-2009 - IPP Printer State Extensions v1.0</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippstate10-20090731-5100.9.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This document defines the new IPP Printer attributes "printer-alert" and "printer-alert-description" plus extensions to the IPP Printer attribute "printer-state-reasons" (defined in RFC 2911) and to the IANA Printer MIB textual convention "PrtAlertCodeTC" (originally published in RFC 3805) as follows:</p>
	    <p>(a) A standard encoding of all of the machine-readable columnar objects in the 'prtAlertTable' defined in IETF Printer MIB v2 (RFC 3805) into substrings of values of the new IPP Printer "printer-alert" attribute defined in this document.</p>
	    <p>(b) A standard encoding of the localized 'prtAlertDescription' columnar object in the 'prtAlertTable' defined in IETF Printer MIB v2 (RFC 3805) into values of the new IPP Printer "printer-alert-description" attribute defined in this document.</p>
	    <p>(c) A standard mapping between the device errors and warnings in the 'PrtAlertCodeTC' textual convention defined in IANA Printer MIB and existing or new values (as needed) of the IPP Printer "printer-state-reasons" attribute defined in IPP/1.1.</p>
	    <p>(d) A standard mapping between the finishing subunit types in the 'FinDeviceTypeTC' textual convention defined in IANA Finisher MIB (originally published in RFC 3806) and new specific values of the 'PrtAlertCodeTC' textual convention defined in IANA Printer MIB and new values of the IPP Printer "printer-state-reasons" attribute defined in IPP/1.1, for high fidelity support of finishing alerts.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.11-2010 - IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 2 (JPS2)</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippjobprinterext10-20101030-5100.11.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This Job and Printer Extensions - Set 2 Specification (JPS2) defines an extension to the Internet Printing Protocol/1.0 (IPP) ([RFC2565], [RFC2566]), IPP/1.1 ([RFC2910], [RFC2911]), and [RFC3380]. This JPS2 consists of a REQUIRED Job Template attribute to print a proof print(s) of the job prior to printing the full run of the job and OPTIONAL Job Template attributes for submitting print jobs that permit a user to save jobs for later reprinting (i.e., retain the jobs indefinitely), provide a recipient name and a job phone number, provide the feed orientation, provide the font name and font size, hold a job until a specific date and time, delay the output of a job (but allow processing) until a specified time period, delay the output of a job (but allow processing) until a specific date and time, and specify an interpreter initialization file.</p>
	    <p>This JPS2 also defines four new REQUIRED operations - Cancel-Jobs, Cancel-My-Jobs, Close-Job, and Resubmit-Job - and a new REQUIRED "job-ids" operation attribute to be used with the existing Get-Jobs and Purge-Jobs operations. Cancel-Jobs allows an operator/administrator to cancel a list of Not Completed jobs or all Not Completed jobs on the Printer. Cancel-My-Jobs allows a user to cancel a list of their Not Completed jobs or all their Not Completed jobs. Close-Job allows a client to close a multi-document job without supplying any additional documents (to support streaming clients and servers). Resubmit-Job allows a user to re-process a modified copy of a Retained Job. Get-Jobs with the "job-ids" attribute allows a user to get a list of jobs. Purge-Jobs with the "job-ids" attribute allows an operator/administrator to purge a list of jobs. There are also Printer Description attributes to list the Job Creation attributes supported indicate whether jobs are spooled and list the set of media collections supported. In addition, conformance to JPS2 also REQUIRES support of the Reprocess-Job operation defined in [RFC3998].</p>
	    <p>Some of the Job Template attributes defined in this specification are also defined to be supplied as Operation attributes in the Hold-Job ([RFC2911]) and Set-Job-Attributes ([RFC3380]) operations.</p>
	    <p>In addition, OPTIONAL semantics for Attribute Precedence, a Queue Override Feature, and a feature to guarantee protocol precedence over the PDL attribute are defined.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.12-2011 - IPP Version 2.0 Second Edition (IPP/2.0 SE)</h3>
	    <p><em>(Obsoletes 5100.10-2009 - IPP/2.0 First Edition)</em></p>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ipp20-20110214-5100.12.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>Since the release of IPP/1.1 (RFC 2910 and RFC 2911), numerous extensions to the IPP protocol have been published as IETF RFCs or PWG Candidate Standards. Many IPP developers are not aware of the existence of many of these extensions, and there is no published document that references all of these extension specifications. As a consequence, only some of the extensions have been implemented.</p>
	    <p>This specification combines all of the previous IPP IETF or PWG IPP extensions into a new base IPP/2.0 conformance level and two new extended IPP/2.1 and IPP/2.2 conformance levels. No new IPP functionality is specified in this document, beyond that defined in the previous IPP extensions.</p>
	    <p>Implementation of this specification will allow printing applications to easily determine the capabilities of an IPP Printer without the need for extensive queries to the IPP Printer.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.13-2012 - IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 (JPS3)</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippjobprinterext3v10-20120727-5100.13.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>Printing on new operating systems, distributed computing systems, and mobile devices emphasizes the challenges of generating document data, discovering available Printers, and communicating that document data to a Printer. This specification adds additional attributes and operations to IPP to better support generic, vendor-neutral implementations of printing in these environments.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.14-2013 - IPP Everywhere</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippeve10-20130128-5100.14.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This standard defines an extension of IPP to support network printing without vendor-specific driver software, including the transport, various discovery protocols, and standard document formats.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.15-2014 - IPP FaxOut Service</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippfaxout10-20140618-5100.15.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This standard defines an IPP extension to support the PWG Semantic Model FaxOut service over IPP.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5100.16-2013 - IPP Transaction-Based Printing Extensions</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ipptrans10-20131108-5100.16.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This document defines extensions to the Internet Printing Protocol that support the business transaction logic needed for paid, PIN, release, and quota-based printing through local and commercial services.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5101.1-2013 - PWG Media Standardized Names 2.0 (MSN2)</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-pwgmsn20-20130328-5101.1.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This document defines standard colorant and media names and naming conventions to be used by other PWG specifications. These lists of names are a superset of the names that are defined in the Printer MIB [RFC3805] and various Internet Printing Protocol documents.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5101.2-2004 - PWG RepertoireSupported Element</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-crrepsup10-20040201-5101.2.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>In traditional printing environments, clients rely on font downloads when they are not sure a given character is embedded in the printer. As printing moves to small clients, downloading may not be an option and clients have a need to know what characters are available in a given device.</p>
	    <p>There are many published named character repertoires, and a small client will not know about them all.</p>
	    <p>To improve operability, this document defines semantics and naming conventions to allow a printer to advertise what repertoires it supports.</p>
	    <p>The primary target of this document is printing using document formats based on XML or HTML (for example, XHTML-Print). It will be less applicable to traditional PDLs (PCL, PostScript, etc.) because they tend to have very format-specific mechanisms for managing character repertoires.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5101.4-2004 - Universal Printer Description Format</h3>
	    <p><a  href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-upd10-20040526-5101.4.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This document describes the concept of a Universal Printer Description Format and the set of schemas it is based on. The schemas describe input for a driver/client to assemble general information about the device and its features, to be used in user interfaces or for printing.</p>

	    <p>HTML 4 is a powerful language for authoring Web content, but its design does not take into consideration issues pertinent to printers, including the implementation cost (in power, memory, etc.) of the full feature set. Printers have relatively limited resources that cannot generally afford to implement the full feature set of HTML 4.</p>
	    <p>Because there are many ways to subset HTML, there are many almost identical subsets defined by organizations and companies. Without a common base set of features, developing print applications for a wide range of printers is difficult.</p>
	    <p>XHTML-Print's targeted usage is for printing in environments where it is not feasible or desirable to install a printer-specific driver and where some variability in the formatting of the output is acceptable.</p>
	    <p>The document type definition for XHTML-Print is implemented based on the XHTML modules defined in the W3C's Modularization of XHTML.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-xpcssprt10-20030331-5102.2.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This specification defines a subset of the Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 specification with additions from the proposed features of Paged Media Properties for Cascading Style Sheets Level 3, to provide a strong basis for rich printing results without a detailed understanding of each individual printer's characteristics.</p>
	    <p>It also defines an extension set that provides stronger layout control for the printing of mixed text and images, tables and image collections.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5102.3-2004 - Portable Document Format: Image-Streamable (PDF/is)</h3>
	    <p><a  href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ifxpdfis10-20040315-5102.3.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This document specifies an application of PDF (Portable Document Format) that has two important properties: First, it is an "image"-based format, and proper rendering of the document is represented by (binary or color) images. Second, the format is suitable for incremental generation and thus it is a "streaming" format. The subset is called "PDF/is", for "PDF Image-Streamable".</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5102.4-2012 - PWG Raster Format</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippraster10-20120420-5102.4.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This specification defines a simple raster format to support printing, scanning, and facsimile without printer-specific driver software on resource-limited clients and printers. The format includes support for a set of standard and device color spaces and bit depths, and defines PWG Semantic Model elements and IPP attributes that enable a client to generate or request a supported raster stream.</p>

	    <p>This specification defines the abstract Web-based Imaging Management Service (WIMS) protocol. This specification defines five operations initiated by a WIMS Agent (embedded in services or devices), largely in support of Schedule-oriented remote management: RegisterForManagement (Agent allows management by an identified WIMS Manager); and UnregisterForManagement (cancel Agent association with a given WIMS Manager); GetSchedule (request a Schedule of planned actions); SendReports (send normal operational message); and SendAlerts (send warning or error exception message). This specification also defines four operations initiated by a WIMS Manager to support more conventional local management: BeginManagement (Manager requests ability to manage an identified Agent); EndManagement (Manager cancels association with Agent); SetSchedule (send a Schedule of planned actions with their timetables); ExecuteAction (execute the single identified action). This specification also defines sets of monitoring, management and administration actions that can be included within a Schedule. Transport bindings for the WIMS protocol are identified in the appendix.</p>

The ISC MIB can be used for fleet management, enterprise billing, field service, and other applications. The ISC MIB is entirely freestanding, but it also facilitates use of the IETF Host Resources MIB [RFC1514] [RFC2790] and IETF Printer MIB [RFC1759] [RFC3805] for imaging device and imaging server monitoring. The ISC MIB was developed by the PWG's Web-based Imaging Management Service (WIMS) project and is based on the PWG Imaging System Counters specification [PWG5106.1].</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5107.1-2005 - PWG Printer Port Monitor MIB1.0</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-pmpportmib10-20051025-5107.1.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This document defines the PWG Printer Port Monitor (PPM) MIB v1.0 that supports printer status monitoring, automatic installation of device drivers, and other printing applications. The PPM MIB is entirely free-standing, but it also facilitates use of the IETF Host Resources MIB (RFC1514 / RFC2790) and IETF Printer MIB (RFC1759 / RFC3805) for printer status monitoring.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5107.2-2010 - PWG Command Set Format for IEEE 1284 Device ID v1.0</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-pmp1284cmdset10-20100531-5107.2.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This document defines a standard format for the COMMAND SET capability in an IEEE 1284 Device ID [IEEE1284], for use: (a) by Imaging Systems (Printers, Copiers, Multifunction Devices, etc.) to encode their supported document formats; and (b) by Imaging Clients (workstations, mobile devices, spoolers, etc.) to decode these Imaging System supported document formats, to enable automatic device driver installation and subsequent Imaging Job submission.</p>
	    <p>This document also defines the IPP Printer Description attribute "printer-device-id" which contains an IEEE 1284 Device ID and corresponds one-to-one with the ppmPrinterIEEE1284DeviceId object
defined in the PWG Printer Port Monitor MIB [PWG5107.1].</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5107.3-2012 - Printer MIB and IPP MFD Alerts</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-pmpmfdalerts10-20120629-5107.3.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This document defines an update to the IANA-PRINTER-MIB (originally published in RFC 3805) to provide support for SNMP alerts in a multifunction device (MFD) and an equivalent update to IPP “printer-state-reasons” (RFC 2911) and IPP “printer-alert” (PWG 5100.9). An MFD is typically based on a printer with added scan- and fax-specific components in order to support print, copy, scan, and facsimile (fax) services. This document defines an update to the IANA-PRINTER-MIB to provide support for new MFD components and component-specific alerts and analogous Printer extension alerts for the existing Input, Output, and MediaPath components.</p>

	  <h2><a name="5108">PWG 5108.x</a> - Semantic Model v2</h2>
	  <div class="panelcontent">
	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5108.01-2011 - PWG MFD Model and Common Semantics v1.0</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-sm20-mfdmodel10-20110415-5108.1.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This specification presents the concepts, semantics and structure of a generalized model of the hardcopy imaging services provided by a Multifunction Device (MFD), a hardcopy device also known as a Multifunction Peripheral (MFP), a Multifunction Printer (MFP) or an All-in-One. This specification is both an overall introduction to the PWG MFD Model and a description of concepts and Elements common to several MFD Services. It is intended to serve as an orientation to the separate PWG specifications defining the MFD Model. The root Element of an MFD, (i.e., System) and the individual MDF Services (e.g., Copy, Print) are more appropriately covered in their own specifications. This MFD Model and Common Semantics specification is technically aligned with a named version of the PWG MFD XML Schema</p>
	    <p>For purposes of this modeling, the services that may be performed by an MFD are: Print, Scan, Copy, FaxIn, FaxOut, EmailIn, EmailOut, Transform and Resource</p>
	    <p>This Document defines:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>The overall MFD model including the terminology and concepts used in the MFD Service models.</li>
	      <li>The models of an MFD Service, Job and Document</li>
	      <li>The “Imaging Service” complex Elements, representing structures appearing in several Services but because of XML Schema restrictions, not instantiated in any Service; the appropriate Services have parallel structures that include some Service-specific Elements.</li>
	      <li>The Elements common to several Services, eliminating the need to repeat these definitions in each Service specification.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5108.02-2009 - PWG Network Scan Service Semantic Model and Service Interface v1.0</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-sm20-scan10-20090410-5108.02.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>Network print devices have evolved to support additional multifunction services, in particular Scan Service. When network Scanners are installed in local office or enterprise networks, they need remote service, device, and job management capabilities so that administrators, operators, and End Users can monitor their health and status. In addition, such network Scanners need remote request for job creation capabilties so that operators ane End Users can create Scan Jobs without depending entirely on local console interfaces. This document defines and semantic model for service, device, and job management and request for job creation for these network Scanners.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5108.03-2009 - PWG Network Resource Service Semantic Model and Service Interface v1.0</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-sm20-resource10-20090703-5108.03.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>When network Multifunction Devices are installed in local office or enterprise networks shared by large groups of users, the ability to provide resources such as job tickets pre-configured with user’s intent (Job Resource), professionally prepared Logos, Fonts, Forms, etc, that can be reused by user’s jobs is very important for office document productivity. This specification defines a Resource Service that provides operators and users a convenient way to remotely store, manage resources so that they can be retrieved and shared later through job creation requests to other services of network Multifunction Devices.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5108.04-2011 - Copy Service Semantic Model and Service Interface v1.0</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-sm20-copy10-20110610-5108.04.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>Network print devices have evolved to support additional multifunction services, in particular Copy Service. When Copy Devices are installed in local office or enterprise networks, they need remote service, device, and job management capabilities so that administrators, operators, and users can monitor their health and status. In addition, such Copy Devices need remote job submission capabilities so that operators and users can create CopyJobs without depending entirely on local console interfaces. This document defines a semantic model for service, device, and job management and job submission for these Copy Devices.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5108.05-2011 - FaxOut Service Semantic Model and Service Interface v1.0</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-sm20-faxout10-20110809-5108.05.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>Network print devices have evolved to support additional multifunction services, in particular FaxOutService. When FaxOut Devices are installed in local office or enterprise networks, they need remote service, device, and job management capabilities so that administrators, operators, and end users can monitor their health and status. In addition, such FaxOut Devices need remote job submission capabilities so that operators and end users can create FaxOut Jobs without depending entirely on local console interfaces. This document defines a semantic model for service, device, and job management and job submission for these FaxOut Devices.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5108.06-2012 - System Object and System Control Service Semantics v1.0</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-sm20-system10-20120217-5108.06.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>Network print devices have evolved to support additional functions. The Multifunction Device (MFD) includes one or more services such as print, scan, copy and facsimile. The MFD Model and Common Semantics [PWG5108.1] extends the original PWG Semantic Model v1 [PWG5105.1] from printing to all of the services that typically may be performed by an MFD. We refer to a device hosting one or more of these services as an Imaging Device.</p>
	    <p>The [PWG5108.1] model extension requires a root element to represent the Imaging Device and to move the print service to be one of the hosted imaging related services. The root of the data model is the System Object. The System Object represents the Imaging Device. The System Object contains the elements that represent the Imaging Device status, description and services. The extension of the model includes bringing in elements that until now were primarily accessed via SNMP. This includes the configuration (i.e., Subunits) and conditions that are represented in the Printer MIB [RFC3805] as entries in the Alert Table (i.e., prtAlertTable). The System Object’s elements contain information that is not visible via any individual service. For example the Imaging Device total usage counters, all conditions from every service, and all Subunits.</p>
	    <p>The Imaging Device hosts a number of services. Many of these services are document related such as print, scan and copy. This specification defines the SystemControlService. The SystemControlService is needed to start (create) services and to restart services that have been previously shut down. It is desirable to be able to monitor and manage an Imaging Device as a whole or all the document related services at once. The Imaging Device’s SystemControlService provides this functionality.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5108.07-2012 - PWG Print Job Ticket and Associated Capabilities Version 1.0 (PJT)</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-sm20-pjt10-20120801-5108.07.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This specification provides the Job Ticket and Capabilities for the Print Service. The Print Service Capabilities are supplied by the Print Service to inform the prospective Print Job Request submitter of the PrintJobTicket elements and element values supported by the Print Service. The PrintJobTicket is supplied by the client, along with Document Data, in a Print Job Request to indicate User intent for the Print Job. The Print Service contains a default PrintJobTicket that provides defaults when the corresponding element is not included with a PrintJob Creation Request.</p>
	    <p>The PrintJobTicket datatype is used by several elements including those that: represent the defaults of the Print Service, represent the user intent in a PrintJob Creation Request, and within the resulting Job Object representing the accepted print intent. A closely related datatype, the Print Service Capabilities, represents which PrintJobTicket elements are supported and what values are permitted. The PWG Semantic Model PrintJobTicket datatype, the associated Print Service Capabilities datatypes and their various instantiations are represented as a subset of the PWG Semantic Model v2 XML Schema. This specification also identifies certain Print Service Description elements relate to formatting the Document.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5110.1-2014 - PWG Hardcopy Device Health Assessment Attributes</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-idsattributes10-20140529-5110.1.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This standard defines a set of attributes for Hardcopy Devices (HCDs) that may be used in the various network health assessment protocols to measure the fitness of a HCD to attach to the network.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5110.2-2013 - PWG Hardcopy Device Health Assessment Network Access Protection Protocol Binding (HCD-NAP)</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ids-napsoh10-20130401-5110.2.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This standard is one part of a set of documentation that defines the application of security policy enforcement mechanisms to imaging devices. This document specifies how the Microsoft Network Access Protection (NAP) protocol is to be used, along with the set of health assessment attributes created especially for HCDs, to allow access to such devices based upon the locally defined security policy.</p>

	    <h3>PWG Candidate Standard 5110.3-2013 - PWG Common Log Format (PWG-LOG)</h3>
	    <p><a href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ids-log10-20130401.5110.3.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	    <p>This standard defines a common log format for hardcopy device events that can be used with existing logging protocols such as SYSLOG. While the focus of this format is on security and auditing of devices, it also supports logging of arbitrary events such as those defined by the IPP Event Notifications and Subscriptions (RFC 3995) specification.</p>
